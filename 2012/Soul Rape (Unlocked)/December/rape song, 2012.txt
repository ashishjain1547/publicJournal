A gang-rape happened on my birthday, now guess what
Except for the little daughters, I am gonna rape this entire world up

I thank you all for the good luck and wishes
I thank you all for the aquarium and fishes
But there ain’t no-thing as free world I would love
I wish I could give all these fishes a hug
I heading my way to the closest ocean,
Leaving this party like I’ve no emotions,
Still I’m glad that you came as I turned twenty-one 
But I’ve pulled so many girls, guts, drugs and guns 
That I feel like I'm living off on one-o-one, hit me
How was I to know there happened gang rape in the city
Whole country is sitting (and) watching it on their TV
PICTURIZING in their minds, how the rapists did it
Then to their daughters, they parents are lying through their teeth
“look at this shit, look at that’s happening, she must not have listened, now she met her fate”
It is not the criminals, but first such mothers (parents) be jailed
Taking liberties of their daughters, it is sick women who are lame
Teaching them hate, how to discriminate
It is the actors, the criminals and political heirs in which the Indians believe
Put them in parliament houses for their personal greed
Then attack Ashish Jain, like I’m the one who caused it
It’s stupid, I don’t even need to give an explanation for this
I’m only holding it back for a daughter-like person who means a lot to me
Plus for me it’s like judgment-day tomorrow,
So I’ve to stop, it won’t be my fault if another rape happens today and drowns this rubbed-off city in sorrow.

CHORUS:
Cuz rapists rape, you know
They love it when you hate, you know
You taught them hate then discriminate, you know 
Now you think that they'll stop, But it’s too late, they know,
Another rape, you'll think you know them better, but they know you don’t.

If rape was big deal, I guess I never should have healed, 
I guess I should have been crying in every rap,
but as a matter of fact I just feel stronger with every dig that they take
Ask me how I feel when they call my girl 'mistake'
Of not my own but when my wife was raped,
It goes back to the time of my early days,
We were living on quarters almost every day.
Rent of the house had over shot by three weeks,
the man had come over to visit the place,
She didn’t speak a word in the eve that day,
I thought I knew the reason so it stayed that way,
I guessed I was the reason, I didn’t earn her much,
I had to traveled cost-free, went to work early and worked after-hours,
the situations changed, I got myself out and got a life I called ours,
Which was when I know my daughter was born,
and then she cleared that it was not my own,
she started the story, tears fell in her lap,
I put hand on her lips as she finished it half,
I kissed her on forehead, 'we're gon make it alright'
I had to let bygones be bygones, not-pull her in-this fight.
I had to be man enough to know what and do that was right,
So next time just tell him when you're seeing that fuck,
“There never went a day when I saw my little girl's face (that) and life didn’t seem easy and problems hadn’t sunk.”

CHORUS:
Cuz rapists rape, you know
They love it when you hate, you know
You taught them hate then discriminate, you know 
Now you think that they'll stop, But it’s too late, they know,
Another rape, you'll think you know them better, but they know you don’t.

This rape gave the world a day to remember, no it’s not nothing else but the eighteenth December
(Now) You got a face for your mistake or I should say blunder pussies,
just wonder how jacking a rod should feel, one ripping you in two pieces, 
Oh now you don’t like violence, I’ll show you violence, 
give you the feeling of that iron, no healing of any (wound) this time when, 
I’m putting those lead bullets in (ya-in) design and, letting you die - so you fuckers don’t make a primetime news, 
and not get the government shit-confused, on handling a public that lit their fuse,
now the congressmen ain’t got nothing to say because
There’re protesters with the banners in their lawns
But before trying to change the politics the angry mob should change (their) psyches first
Hatred is a mother-fucking thing that (always) (just) gets reimbursed
Just look in you, problem lies right over there, it’s alive over there
When wasn’t it the same man from the protest then coming back home and slapping his wife, 
He wasn’t telling his daughter about her boyfriend like it was one hell of a crime, 
Okay now ask why they fuck their whores (women) to try for a son the third time,
On these assholes, there's no need for me to waste another beat, another rhyme, or another punch line, cuz

CHORUS:
Cuz rapists rape, you know
They love it when you hate, you know
You taught them hate then discriminate, you know 
Now you think that they'll stop, But it’s too late, they know,
Another rape, you'll think you know them better, but they know you don’t.
