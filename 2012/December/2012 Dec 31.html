0500: Sent this rap to Mahima to make her mood a little bit:
<i>
Okay motherfucker then you thought you can get her too,
After Anisha, you thought you could wish for Naina too,
but puss, Mahima wasn’t your right choice-rather 
she was your worst, she had the protector,
horrible than Hannibal lector, to get-her in you' dreams, you gotta get past me, 
showing you your worst fears, 
turning your e’ery dream into your worst nightmare, 
your last bitch will now know here, 
she was butt-fucking stupid, blundering idiot too, 
when she thought you were for her and she was for you, 
now all them bitches wish it that they had Ashish too, 
wish what he did for Mahima, and not-know-how what pussy dickhead Ojas do,
he thinks of opening up them bitches and put in there his shoe, 
cuz he ain’t got two balls to do the right things that I do, 
maybe he has four which he thinks will get the ladies wooed,
NOOO, NAHT, not now, nah,
two make up man, but four don’t make a superman,
still if you think you the man of steel,
I will make it clear, you nothing but like a loose nut in the giant wheel....</i>

1145-1220: Anje called me outside. We were in the park and we sat on the bench to talk. It was only this man from A200 on the next bench earlier then he got up and left. Then as we sit on it, he came back and sat with us, unnecessarily. He wanted to hear us talk, what fucking else. 
Prabhav (on phone), and Yash (raised hand for distant-hi) had passed from the B1 parking. Dhruv (B23) with his father, pricks were sorry for the last meeting that we had.
Vani-Koni’s mother passed from the sidewalk to enter C-block - we were on the close bench and I just looked at her as she was coming and then took the turn into the block. Her face is jaw-y so kind of a reminder of Anshu Randy for me, but this woman’s face is in length.
1750: Jatin called me to come on pink-Hanuman-temple near Mother Dairy.
    • As I was waiting for Jatin to come here, a girl in black tights with yellow belly-line was waiting for her cab, a white SUV. I saw a same vehicle standing in my way, later near Delhi Police Apartments.
    • 469 came on stop on time; I got a seat next to a chubby face cute young-woman. A woman asked me for seat, I stood up and then she said “It's okay, keep sitting” and went ahead, ass-crack.
    • Jatin knew abt the five minutes of showy protest by Naina's NGO on the society gate.
    • In the evening, this driver staring at me – black, upper-lip thick moustache, broad face – square – some C-block flat duty – he used to be around when I was in ninth and used to play basketball in the C-block-B3-block parking.
    • Amogh's car back-hatch-back cover dented by an Omni - earlier his bike had got scratches when the Bunty Thief had pushed it and it fell on the ground, Amogh had gone over to him to have verbal fit with him.
1910: Call to M from Appu’s phone – she picked it up – told me that she was not going to come – I was telling her if she was making ‘Khichdi’ – I told to now come down and see us again - she put down phone when I was trying to push her – I was only for 30 minutes – fuck her
Appu had her same old number – I thought she had switched to a new one
    • Three calls to her, one at 2130 using  FW’s phone, she lets them go to the full ring
    • M hadn’t picked one call today, no matter what phone I use. I had tried from chachi’s (FW) phone in the evening.
    • When I was returning home from the inside street of Pandav-Nagar - brown overcoat and black pants - Megha-fatso-Database used to put on such pair
    • Jatin’s reminder - bearded, French, thick - thick frame - head-cap - standing before Mother-dairy near a bike - I thought it was him but he was not responsive so it wasn't him - Jatin told me enter the road to Pandav Nagar - this person was coming back on the other side of this road now - a motherfucking set-up
    • I was sitting in the park around 2100, when I came back to the B2 block to get back home, a woman in blue sweater and blue jeans asked for lift - I ask her for address - B42 - I told her the way to B2 block stairs - she said 'thanks', me 'yeah...' - plain-blue-sweater and jeans, copying me, my style. Her face was like I had seen her at NIEC or something, also in Laxmi Nagar in the evening; I felt if I was seeing faces that I may have seen at NIEC, distant lookalikes.
That woman in black over-all body hugging and the dark-blue-line of the inner-top visible to show off the shape of her belly. Her friend in the suit looked back with her short-length-wide eyes straight for a snatched glance back at me.
    • I was in the market to get photocopy of previous year question papers. Paritosh Dhama from 9th class used to come over and flaunt his muscles in the class with Prateek Ahuja, also with his own friends in the corridors. He had come over to buy DVD with this person who works in the other cyber-cafe near the turn. 
    • When I reached just past the Agarwal Sweets, Shubham Kainthola and Vinayak met me here. After handshakes, he asked me my university, I let out air from pressed lips like 'how can you forget that' as I said 'IP university'. 
    • He was quick in asking questions, he was a god-damn put up, sent to give me some recollection. Near the end of the conversation, he asked me if I had his number, as I was looking into my phone, he then forced me to say out mine. He took it down but didn’t give me a call. So now, Shubham takes my number here, okay. He immediately said that we should meet sometime and I said 'yeah', so handshake with both and the two now left. I had asked of his branch, and then the placement scene in both our colleges. He had said it out a number of times if I study a lot, and that I don’t even go out or around. 
    • Before leaving, Shubham wished me for New Year.
    • In the society, with Harshit and Amogh, pricks. Harshit told me that I had told him of the stalking misunderstanding that had happened on the KG back in third semester, and the police-case that she had then filed. He was with his some other friend. I let Ammo tap hard on my back and there was this person in the parking with his back here.
    • It was pretty confusing and problematic for mind as to what Shubham did right now. He took my number and didn’t give me his, WTF was that. When I was throwing hands and fits on reaching near society, there was a man following me.
    • Anje's reminder through the use of gait and hood, I called back twice. He simply didn’t catch it.
    • Even after having passed Maitri APPT – I was still screaming out “fuck, fuck” – throwing hands, punching hand in hand – walking like a hood-guy
    • On reaching close to the Manu-society-gate – Chaudhary was standing on the first car and watching the road here – so he just sees me – I just calmed down to a totally controlled gait
My health has been sick, I have a nose problem. Repeated sneezing has resulted in damage to the internal of the nose, A sneeze and nerves in the forehead are crunched and released, pains in the middle of the forehead and above the right brow.

Person reminders of Ahlcon school teachers:
28-Dec on Evening Metro: English - 9th - Mudita ma'am - chinky, tall, fatso-baggy-physique, 6-feet-or-close

31-Dec, the aged phy teacher, 5-2, round face, round-glass-silver-frame, saree - near pink temple
And of Sonali Das.

The girl was Punjabi. Sardar shown to me on 22nd, the girl had this parrot-like-nose the Punjabi have it mostly
