29-Sep-2012
The day started at 1100. After getting fresh, I was back in the room, Prashant and Srishti were here and Srishti was asking him for shampoo, I hated to see the drama. I was just roaming around here and it was at 1210 that I thought of having breakfast. I was not called for it, nor did I think if anything was made. When I was just roaming around here on seeing the breakfast kept covered in the kitchen, now aunt called out from living-room to tell me to eat, and she then came over to me on the dining-table to tell me to take the milk by myself. Actually, she asked if I can or not take the milk by myself. That was creepy; I felt that she wanted me to feel the change after Prashant came back last night, which is until Monday.
I was watching TV and it was ‘Spider-man-3’ coming on it.  I just sat to watch that until I was eating, I usually eat slowly while sitting before TV and it is pathetic. Srishti and amma have usually been telling me about my mouth that would remain opened once something interesting appears on TV. I was eating vermicelli, the breakfast until 1315 and then I just got up and left the thought of movie. I was thinking of watching one on Notebook though, I didn’t.
I got my sleeper fixed again, it just broke yesterday. I had left Sneha a message last night to tell her to ask sir for exam-date, I told her that though I know it is some next Saturday but she should still ask to just make sure that sir gets his mind set.
I was in Anu’s room and as I lay there only to rest for a minute, I was asleep for two hours until 1530. I had said no for lunch earlier, though aunt had asked twice I guess, and I had the milk before sleeping. I had tea and then I was sitting. I was just pushing files from yesterday into proper folders and it sucked an awful lot of time. I got up around 1800 and I had dinner by 1830. Babaji would be watching this Jain-channel almost like daily, and Jain-Muni would give speech. I don’t know, what they talk makes sense but it feels like ‘does it even matter today, in this time’.
After roaming around, I sat again by 1930 and I was writing some on ‘Art’ and ‘Logic’, it felt awesome, I felt a lot relieved. I kept feeling that the college people's Discipline Committee and their hired detectives are trying to steal my thoughts. I wanted myself to know that neither Art nor Logic can be copied, though both can be stolen, so I only need to remain calm while they watch me. They will only look stupid if they simply go on copying me.
Tuition-DCS2 didn’t happen today but I got the message for tomorrow.
I was on internet for a while around 0000 and I was back in the room about the day by 0130 and sat by 0230. I was just roaming in the kitchen and dining-room thinking about what I saw on FB.
It was ‘Yamini Sarada (the-old-fake-principle)’ appearing in the friend-suggestions ‘People you may know’. Maybe in the last month or so or earlier, it was ‘Kavita-HOD-from-First-Block’ appearing in there. It happens when one’s friend suggest us people who we might know. It is only RET (REQ-ELI) sir and fourth-semester (Discrete Math) sir who were mutual friends. Kavita madam’s profile appeared to be a fake at first, though it had her pathetic photos. Also, she was using the name ‘KAVITA-NIEC’, what the fuck does college-name ‘NIEC’ mean in there. Well I only have say ‘fuck it’ and just let go.
Yesterday I had been thinking of studying Organizational Behavior (from V Semester) but that never happened and today I thinking of doing some AJAX and that too never happened. One thing that is there is that the day felt a lot better than how last three four days had been.
-OK [0400]
