30-Sep-12
I just read the letter I had written to Communication-Skills staff some 6 months earlier. I never read it again due to being extremely busy all this time. I just read and I was trying to understand it how it must have been interpreted by the eldest fatso Shweta, the sexy-broad-face-broad-shoulder Anshu and sexy-newbie-shorty Manisha. I was trying to introduce stress, expressions, stretch on different lines and punches in the letter to understand how they might have seen it. Like in ‘thanking-you’ I thought of emphasis on ‘you’ for fatso and Shorty, but for Anshu I thought of normal way of thanking a person by letting ‘you’ just for name sake and saying ‘TH’ sound still clearly. I was always thinking I had written something too manipulative, but on reading after 6 months, it seemed to be just okay and nothing so serious like how I was getting emotional while writing it. Until last week, I had tried to find it in the old writings, but I was not able exactly get to the date and today I just sat with head for it and I got it without much effort.

I would often be thinking that I had being wrong in the letter while stating the reason behind the use of ‘EI’ and ‘IE’ in ‘receive’ and ‘believe’. I had written that it must have to do something with words ‘receipt’ and ‘belief’, but the words don’t really have the parent-child relation. Then I read the letter again and I hadn’t asked them ‘how is it’, I had asked ‘why is it, what it is’, so I think I could be right while trying to look at some word that might have influenced.

Yesterday, I was not willing to allow any thoughts about NIEC or anything in the morning, when it would be anything like any faculty or anything, I would tell myself to simply forget about NIEC in totality and just remember that it is IPU that I am enrolled in, and exactly the college. But it was not so at night, I was thinking if the people there want me to join them, whatever, however, but it was just baseless to have those thoughts of expecting anyone, at this moment it was The-Principle in my head. I just told myself to let it go easy and out.
I was watching ‘Max PAYNE’ at night around 0415 until 0530. I had been downloading subtitles for it earlier, this was crazy.
It was 1130 when babaji came into the room to shout on me, he was saying something I made humanity by not waking up until now. Inside myself, I was like ‘what the fuck man, shut up’. I was sitting in the toilet thinking about the Tanuja Nautiyal (the backstabber) and Anshu (the-broad-face) again, I was waiting for shit to drop but it wasn’t happening. It was at 1210 that I sat for breakfast, the food had been brought from Jain-Temple as the ten-holy-days period ended yesterday, today was ‘Day of Forgiveness’. I sat by 1240 and just waiting for myself to start. It happens that in filled stomach one cannot sit. My mind was still thinking about the two women, Tanuja and Anshu; it seems that I have be fantasying about them a lot and together, WTF. I chose to meditate to get some relief, and then fat-whore passed ice-cream here, I was like ‘no’ but still took it. I was studying Organizational Behavior (Planning) by 1340 and at 1500, I had chips and Poha. I was sitting with a volatile mind but I did sit for long time. I was watching news on the love-affairs of in between Bollywood actors, it seemed interesting. I had food along with; I was back in the room by 1930 and sat to write.
Srishti wore this Salwar-suit that looked hot on her, as it fitted her well, and it has been good Salwar or slacks there looks no such thing different, sexy on sexy legs. Yeah, Srishti looked hot, or it was just the effect of the suit.
I was just writing and then around 2130, Gaurav called to tell me that he won’t be coming tomorrow. I tried to contact Sneha but she didn’t reply to the two messages and didn’t pick up the phone. I then left Hemanshu a message, the guy is so fucking stupid, he wished that he could join other batch and then give the exam later, mother-fuck. I called sir to tell him for tomorrow and he said let it be off tomorrow and on the day after on 2-Oct is Birthday of Gandhi, so he told me to come on third, Wednesday. I wanted to tell him to end it up and not pull it but he sounded baffled now and he cut my call without a proper note.
In the morning at 1100 message came from that class was delayed to 1500 from 1300. At 1200, message came that class was postponed to Tuesday, wow. The first thought that came to mind when I got the message for cancellation of class was, it should be the college Discipline Committee to let me get some break after how they made my last week so stressful on the regular. Then there was also a message from unknown number that advertized some Public-speaking and personality-development academy, WTF, it was a deed of college Discipline Committee.
India won the do-or-die match against Pakistan in World cup T20 first round.
-OK [2240]
