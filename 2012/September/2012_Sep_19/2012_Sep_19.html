19-Sep-2012

Anu woke me up before leaving at 1000, she told me stay up in the house as I was alone. The cleaning-maid came and soon after her came amma. I had planned to not go to the college today, so I just did that way. After I was on internet after midnight, I had come to the room late at 0240; I then instead of going to bed, took out the Digital Circuits and Systems II books and just tried to get started with the subject. I went to bed at 0345.

In the morning, I had brushed by the time it was 1100 and I just sat to do some study, I didn’t know what, so I started with introducing myself to AJAX, only the program that I need to know for the Omicron Project. At 1240, I called on Gaurav’s number to know what happened at HCL today, his mother picked up and he was not available. I just kept myself busy with the 6 and a half pages of code. At 1415, I sent message to Gaurav to ask him about today, but he didn’t reply.

By the time, it was 1500, amma had started telling me to eat food, and she was going crazy as the time was passing. She would sound irritated and would irritate the third and the fourth time.

The water-tap in amma’s bathroom has started to leak; it doesn’t close and would flow heavily if not closed properly with patience. The society-plumber has not been coming over to fix it. He just told the name of the part to be fixed; now we find him to know the name, amma knew it but she forgot. She would stand in the balcony to look for him, funny. After having got over with going through the code once, I had food around 1600 and then I went to the market to get the parts of the tap. Both Srishti and fatty Prashant had been to their colleges the whole day, so I was free at home today.

At 1700, I had called Gaurav and he told me that sir has been teaching JSP again and Sneha has not yet talked about the class ending. She is using him now, fuck her.

At 1830, amma again started saying about food. It is Daslakshani/Daslakshan days for next ten days. I had to eat, I shut down the Notebook and sat to eat, I was to eat two Roti, but because fatty Prashant didn’t eat his two, I ate four. I was slow and I finished eating by 1930. There had been news that fatty aunt and uncle were going to be back in the evening today, damn.

I was just sitting in my bed and then I thought of getting the head bald to tiny bits of hair. I just jumped, took Rs 20 from amma and got to barber’s shop. It was 2000 when I left home, and I just sat for a while outside the shop as he was busy, he took like fifteen minutes to his job. I told him to use the machine on entire head, and there we went. When he was half-done, he left me like that for about a minute, I looked into the mirror and it was like horrible, what the fuck, I looked like an old man, with moon on his head, damn it, but then it was fine. I just sat calm with little smile to show that. He was done soon. I got this look which I had once adored in the third-semester.

I was back at home and amma’s first words were, ‘what the hell have you done’. I was here on the wash-basin and I didn’t very much like it, but it isn’t hate-able either, it is just fine. When I was in babaji’s room, he said it is okay, no problem. I was back here in the room, I was standing here at the wash-basin before and the bad news came, uncle and aunt were here in the living room. I just came to my bed on closing the door. It was some 2100; aunt was surprised to see the bald-look of mine. I was just not in the mood to study so watched some song-videos to pass time.

Amma called me to her room to stop the tap from running; I passed from the empty living room to get to amma’s room. When I was coming back, uncle was turning on the fan in the living-room and Srishti was in the dining room, as I was passing from there, she saw me and her reaction was, ‘shit, what did you do’, uncle jerked off a laugh, I don’t think he turned to take a look, even better.

I myself haven’t liked my look very much, but it will be fine, I bet. I remember that Srishti had passed on a small black comb to me when the uncle had been here the last time or before. Now that I have got this tiny-bald-hair-do just out of nowhere, and if the uncle would link as a reaction to the taking of that comb, I don’t really have an idea of what thought it might pop up in him, fuck it, like I care.
I plan on not going to the college even tomorrow.
-OK [2330]
