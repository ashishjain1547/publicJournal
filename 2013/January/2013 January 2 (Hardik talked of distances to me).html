<pre class="">2-Jan-13
Dish washer maid is mixed with 'Surveillance Team'. She is telling to come once in a day, down from two times. 
The maid in our house used to come two times a day. Once after lunch and then after dinner.
Then a Muslim maid had come over to wash dishes here (I think Discipline Committee / Surveillance Team had sent her). Seema aunt didn’t say ‘yes’ to her.

<i class=""><b class="">Confusing paragraph: </b>Karishma Garg’s (from NIEC (now ADGITM)) frog princess photo on FB (from last days of November). Somebody called the questioning guy an ‘a******’ and now the guy says like being drawing back from the conversation, ‘okay I get it, now I know who is the frog’. I unfollowed the post.

• 1415: Ankur sent a message in the syntax of HDK: “Happy new year bro”. "That was it, a Discipline Committee act", I thought in my suspicions.
• 1420: I thought to call Mahima from Seema aunt's phone and then some 17 minutes later once from my own. She cuts the call. Good, I was only about ask her if I should have called her to come down when I am with Anjaneya.
• No studies throughout the afternoon. Sat down at 1750.

<h3 class="">INFRARED SURVEILLANCE AND DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE NETWORK</h3>

• 1800: Aditya (in 9th class, from B3), Harsh (in 7th class, from B1), Sarthak (in 7th class, from A2) came asking for ball. I just got along with them for a game

• "The maid from the hut next to temple of the neighborhood" was going for the lift.

• Uni’s mom was on the round.

• I had come back home and then I was back to TT room again to do some revision of the notes.

• Aditya was helping in memorizing.

• 1840-or-something: Mahima’s mom came looking for Mahima with badminton racket in her hand. And she asked me as I was sitting with the notes in hand.

• 1915: Mahima came to the TT room and stood there in the stairs. I asked for playing after some time then she asked me why I had called. I told her for Anjeneya and me, if she ever feels like. She then asked Vishwas for badminton, then asked me ‘TU AYEGA’ – I said okay, but I was to come down by myself. She refused to call. She said 5 to 7 but then anytime would do 5, 6 or whatever.

• Mahima left without any indication or anything. Her poor communication skills.

• 1925: Hardik called and I let Vishwas answer it since I was playing. Hardik came to the TT room and sat here as I was reading the planning topic to him. Vishwas and we left the TT room, and then Vishwas left.

• 1945: Appu (Drishesh) came

• I had talked of the Swati Tondon to him. The lady should be like 29-plus and she’s unmarried, earns some over a lac (INR) per month from a bank job, has a car, went to Delhi University and Mater Dei. I don’t know, I am feeling bored of her now.
[Mater Dei school for girls, was established in 1956, by the Sisters, Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. This is a Christian Minority School.]

• Hardik talked of distances to me. Of college and back-forth and this and that around there and where. Brutal, man, what did he want.

• I also told her of the fight between us and me last night.

• Tarang Mahajan (CSE2) [Look Alike] jogging on the rounds.

• Nishant Adhikari [Look Alike] coming from the gate yesterday.

• Anirudh’s mom passed from the B1 parking while looking here as I was a reading a Planning-definition.

• Chaudhary security guard was talking on phone as Appu (Drishesh), Hardik and I took three rounds.

• Amogh had called Hardik. Hardik told him of just going back home and that it was ‘him, Appu and Ashish’. Amogh cut the call. Cool, I didn’t want him either.

• Prabhav passed from the B1 parking.</pre>
