"Right people at the right time" outside window [Infrared Effect]

• New rule: no looking outside, no looking out for opportunities – just focus on getting this degree and getting out

<h3>• Construction work continues</h3>

Seema aunt has now put up new sheds after years, society is happy.

1400: called Shweta Sharma to ask if she wanted to rethink on holding a meeting on 16-17 as it was sat-sun on the two days.

She said to come on 18th; she will be free from the fest related work.

I was easy and fine in using English. She said ‘son’ to refer to me in the end.
• Before I had made that call, it was all brooming going on outside and around the balcony as I was sitting in living room. The sound of the brooming was disturbing.
• Later, surveillance team showed reminder of Anshu. ‘Spitting’ through cars was off. Kittu’s car was there (driving lesson).
• Reminders of Mahima, tuition, and Omicron.

• It was always about "Automated Text Analysis".

<b>What are the odds that I would be doing the "Automated Text Analysis"</b>
Project (1 – it was definitely going to be made), idea (1 – mine, 0 - others), Team (1 – with, 0 - without)
00: combination is not possible. This is "it was definitely going to be made" and "without team". 
11, 10: meant new idea; '11' meant new idea because Mukesh and Rizwan were incapable.
01: meant others idea with team
So it was 2 on 3: a 66.66 percent chance that I was going to have ATA

Cats, dogs, crows sounds – infrared
• The extent is so crazy that sometimes it felt that Metro passing from the bridge was synced with infrared
• Dogs barking outside and infrared

~ ~ ~

Few protocols I have to keep in mind when I go out:

1) “Not the sh*t that’s thrown at you”

2) Mind your own business (protocol 10)

3) Listen, don’t hear

4) Stop smiling, get your back straight (protocol 5)

5) There isn’t one party at work but four (Uncle/Prashant, College, Society, Surveillance Squad)

6) Don’t let negative sh*t take on you, don’t let positive either

7) Be organized, disciplined, intelligent, tough (be a militant)

<b>One month long plans of the surveillance team</b>

Sep: Preliminary following – positive and testing. They were having the diaries monthly.

Oct: Following in College (pulls). Diary with them

Nov: Pulls and tougher testing. Hardik and Mahima got involved. Last edition from the Sky-Drive

Dec: Drishesh and Mahima got involved. Infrared surveillance and following.

Jan: Anshu (English teacher), Tanuja Nautiyal Backstabber on Metro. They are on a setback with my phone off.

Feb: Babaji getting defensive.

Mar: Automated Text Analysis / Exam Results / and... <h3 class="">...Brain Stoning</h3>
