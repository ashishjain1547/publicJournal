Those who think that military's main objective is to preserve the new freedoms will soon be disappointed. From Chile in 1973 to Pakistan in 1999 (and several times before that), long is the histroy of military takeovers that were welcomed in their first hours and days but regretted in the years of despair that followed.

Provisions in National Food Security Bill
�	5 kg of rice, wheat or millets at R3, R2 and R1 per kg/month per person
�	R1.31 lakh crore, annual estimated cost to government (raising it spending on ration for the poor by nearly a third or 31%)
�	67% of all Indians, or 800 million people, covered
�	The bill is the second of two large entitlement-based welfare legislations of the UPA. The previous one, a rural pay-for-work scheme or MNREGA, had helped the UPA win a second term, analysts say.

As seen from the recent cases of spot fixing by Sreesanth (IPL) and the case fake encounter by Gujarat police in the June of 2004, the court and investigation agencies nail known people for their criminal acts with even more harder grip than the criminal cases of the lesser known or the common public. It is due to the media attention that the case gets, and sometimes because of its political aspects.

The poorest three billion people on earth, short of half the world people on earth, short of half the world population accounted for about 7% of carbon emission, while conversely, the richest 7% of people accounted for about half of all emissions.
