*
0600: I had gone to sleep on sofa after a night staying awake and thinking of securing my files more.
0700: I woke up and fat-dick was running back to his room from the corner of my room. I went to my room and the drawer-bar was still opened. I closed it and came back to get some rest in amma's bed. It was not possible. I put my laptop and tablet from the drawers to babaji's cupboard and went to see what was he doing in his room. He was in bathroom with his things aligned here to say things, underwear rim forming an 'A', belt placed over it in large to form a 'V', his black collared t-shirt with '08' written on arm side. I took up his belt and threw it in random, and picked up the water bottle to put its cap on the underwear and took the bottle with me. I lay on the sofa to watch him come out as I let the door remain opened. Then I went back and made a 'B' of the belt, good. 
Now, 0715, babaji and amma came back from temple, babaji flipped open the door to balcony and the lights too, WTF. I just lay as I was, fatty Prashant came out and closed the door. I had got newspaper in my hand to read and when he came out he was real baffled, confused and showing toughness with nothing at its core or inside. He asked for water-bottle from amma.
He left for his classes of whatever early on.
*
There was real good disturbance outside after this. Sehgal (from first floor A7 block) was talking in audible volume. Watchmen, Amar Singh, talking in audible voice and clanking the metal knob. Dustbins of lime green (the same color as the suit of Anshu) color placed in view from the door to balcony of amma's room.

"The government-critics' phraseology is uncannily similar: stalled reforms, policy missteps, mounting deficits, galloping inflation, fractious politics and creaky infrastructure - the rough edges are coming off, all at the same time."
