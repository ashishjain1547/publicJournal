<pre>Rohit is a funny guy, you should definitely meet him once. I know him from my school days and if I go bezerk and candid while writing this piece, he might sue me for defamation (that's what he says). 

<i>
"There is an interesting incident that he would like me to share. I am poor guy, you know that.

He once took me for a dinner in a restaurant along with a common friend (Amit Kushwaha) and when I refused to contribute my share, he paid it on my behalf.
Now, I hadn't asked him for this dinner so why would I pay? Getting it. But he insisted that I stay with them anyway.

Next day, when Amit and Rohit told me about my share, I refused to pay and I owe him those Rs 300 till this day.

But I am changed man now, Rohit and I went for lunch at the Big Chill Cafe (Delhi) about a fortnight back and I surprised Rohit by offering to pay the whole bill. I saw tears of joy in Rohit's eyes and he offered that we should split it equally. 

Rohit is the only guy who finds me interesting and he tells this to me very often.
He also tells me that I have a lot of capabilities and intelligence but I have underachieved so far.

Now the last time when Rohit came back in my life was when I put a message in a group if anyone was available for a conversation. And, then Rohit called me that night."
</i>

We were on the phone call when I started writing this post and he made me write the part put into the italics above.

This is all true and he didn't mention a couple of more outings I had with him like the Noida, Sector 35 outing that we had in December, 2021.

Today, I can say Rohit is one person who knows me very, very, very well. He has read my blogs and been with me during the toughest phases of my life. 
Our recent series of trysts started happening after that phone call I received from him on the night of November 5th, 2021.

He makes fun of me and makes me laugh. He reads my blog and tells me correct a post about his white Wagon-R where I said it didn't have an air-conditioner but Rohit insists that it did but he never used it because he disliked what I used to talk to him.

It was back in 2014, I was still recovering from the "Dopamine Overflow" in my head. I was suffering from auditory hyper-sensitivity.
It was given to me by my teachers at my college (ADGITM), people in the society, friends in the society and my family alike (except Srishti).

Rohit is not that serious guy who would solve a science or math problem for you. He would give you his thought or opinion on the problem and how it could be solved but he would just shake his head mostly, make jokes about it and let that topic go off with his colorful jokes.

How would you react if I told you that:
"People follow me."

Or that:
"I'm under surveillance."

I cannot tell what goes in people's minds when they hear it but Rohit did not rationalize with me about it and simply gave a sympathetic ear. 

I am an awful writer, I digress a lot. This post was supposed to be about Rohit but it turns out to be about my friendship with him. Shall start over some other day, till then, see you!

PS: I might have written a word or two about him in my 2008 journal when we were in the same class. The class of XII (D), Ahlcon Public School, 2008.
