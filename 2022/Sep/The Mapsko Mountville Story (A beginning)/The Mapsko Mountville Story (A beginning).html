Like many other stories, this story too opens up with an incident (a fight) between mom and me.
It was not a good day for me. I wasn't feeling very well. In the afternoon around 3, mom was having lunch in the room 75 ground inner.
We were having an argument.
My argument was as usual that mom should shut up and her arguments varied from tenants to Moti to eating habits to water to what not.
After I had my head spinning, I decided to step outside for a while for a massage and decided that I cannot live with this woman who is also my mother.
I had thoughts of Manju bua's words coming back to my mind that "Sadhana speaks incessantly at times".
That "at times" is more frequent than the other things we say happen "at times".

Once I was back from the spa, I still had my temper up and I was now lying in bed and installing property and real estate purchase apps.
Next, there were a couple of properties for which I had shown interest to the brokers and dealers.
One of these properties was Signature Global park, an upcoming housing project in Gurugram.
Amid that spell of messages that I had sent to set up meetings with property dealers, there had been one of the recipient who went by the name Japnit Singh.
From Amrocks.
Next morning, I was on a proposed call from the last evening with Japnit.
He called me before 11 AM to set up the meeting and as decided he was going to arrange for a cab ride to the property, have a discussion and then arrange cab ride to back home.
I met him outside his office in DLF Cyber city.
Once we were riding in his car, we were talking of Signature Global project but the property was under construction and I had to ask him to drop it from choices.

Japnit Singh showed a couple of apartments to me but the prices of these were outside my reach.
After the discussion was not going anywhere, I asked him what is the rough range in which I can expect to buy property here in Gurugram.

The prices of the apartments at Mapsko Mountville were in the range starting around 1 crore.
The prices were too high compared with the amount of principal I was having that was roughly 50 Lacs.
The variety of flats here was sort of like this: 
There were 3 BHK flats with a plot size of 1490 sq. feet. Then there were the 3 BHK flats with extended balcony. The extended balcony streched out more than the normal balcony in my flat, so would get a sitting area in the balcony and a better view of city. After this were the 3.5 BHK or 4 BHK flats. 
While we were seeing these flats, Japnit carried a paper with tabular data in his hand. It was the list of flats that he said were still available. It was a lie. Society had a lot more fresh flats, and a lot on resale. Then there was also a new tower coming, the tower I. When I think back about it, I think of it as a lesson. Lying or passing on misleading information in negotiations is fine and fair long as you don't get caught, otherwise defining what lying is legally stands beyond the scope of this article.

So the question came from me once we had seen a couple of flats. "Please show me the cheapest unit. Flats worth 96 lacs or 1 crore are outside my reach."
Japnit said his team and Mapsko's CRM Gita Chhabra also have a banker from SBI who could help me in financing my housing needs.
Still Japnit was as dicy as I was about how much loan I could get.
Before we move forward and walk to Mapsko's sales office, Japnit said he could help me get a unit for as low as 88 lacs at best and amount lower than that was out of scope.
Once we got into the meeting room at Mapsko's sales office, there we met this handsome young man Yogesh Gautam.
Japnit and I reiterated our discussion about financial crunch at my end and the high prices of the units that we saw here.
Yogesh asked me, "sir, how are you ariving at the decision that price of a unit should be 85 lacs or 88 lacs?" To this, I had no answer. I had not prepared for this question in negotiation. From a random discussion with a person in car enroute to Rampura Chowk estimated that I had purchased the flat at the rate roughly equaling: "1 lac per gaj". 
The closing pitch by Yogesh Gautam was this, "Please let Japnit and me go discuss about our situation and then I promise you once we'll come back I will offer you a price that you won't be able to reject".
When he came back after a couple of minutes, he had the booking form with him.
He sat down, put out the paper between us, repeated his promise to me and filled in the amount at 88,47,777 INR or some number like that around 88.5 lacs and said, "sir, your turn to sign".
I cannot tell the exact thoughts that went in my head. I had felt a bit of frustration, a bit of disappointment, a bit of urgency to take the offer. But then instead of thinking, I looked at Japnit and he said, "sir, you are getting a furnishing of roughly 10 lacs. ACs from Daikin, bathroom fittings from Kohler", etc.
To this I picked up the pen signed the paper and did a UPI transfer of 1 lac booking amount.
After that I had a lunch of sandwiches and chips and a cab was arranged for me to back home.
I had one month to pay the entire amount of 88 lacs.
I was not willing to take a loan right off. I wanted to  arrange the money I had with me for this housing project and then take the loan for the rest of the amount that I need to reach 88.5L.
The first thing I had to do was get funds out of my savings in index funds and clear my existing loan of 15 lacs that I had taken for financing the renovation of house in Tri Nagar.
Next I went back to ICICI bank to check for home loan from them but they said given my salary of 55K, at best I could get a home loan of maximum 50 lacs.
At ICICI, the condition for home loan was that I should do FD of registry amount of about 7 lacs with them. That was going to put me in need of loan amount exceeding my potential.
With SBI, you get a time of about 3 months to submit the registry amount and get a loan only for apartment price.
As the 1 month period was approaching an end, I decided to go with SBI.
I had visit the RACPC office of SBI in Gurugram after that my loan sanction manager Amit Punj took my signatures in his car at Inderlok metro station.
I had to visit the RACPC office of SBI in Gurugram once...
A loan amount of 48 lacs was sanctioned in my name and transferred to the Mapsko builders for my flat allotment.
There I became the owner of my own flat, own house but at a huge cost. Before that day, I had 48 lacs in surplus and now I was in 48 lacs debt.
