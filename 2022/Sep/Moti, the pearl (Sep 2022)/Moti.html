<i>I was going to name this piece "'MOTI' A MURDER MYSTERY" but chose to go with 'Moti, the pearl'. This post was written across a period several days and you might notice how I was able to tamp down my emotions as days passed on.</i>

Do you know what makes up a good story? A murder. But have I committed a murder? No. But still I feel like I am a murderer.
Moti was merely born that winter in the month of March when I brought him home.
I am so full of tears right now.
It all started from an advice in a book "12 rules for life" by Jordan Peterson.
The twelfth rule said "PET A CAT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER ONE ON THE STREET".
If you would read the twelfth chapter from the book, you would figure out that the author goes on to talk more about dogs than cats, being a dog owner.
I followed that advice when I pick up a ball of fur, a puppy born on the side walk of a street.
Even though I am writing to "let it out" but I can't stop feeling sorry and sad for what I have done.
What I am going through. The pain, the guilt.

In the afternoon of September 9th, I let Moti go near a park / garbage dump near Tri Nagar area.

I spoke about him with everyone I knew and who knew him except Bhawna's family.
By doing that, I was just comforting myself at a time, when that poor little thing has no one to turn to in this cruel world.
Mrs Nirmal, Sunita maid, Moni cook, Rohit, tenants such as Rani and Akant, Srishti, Shruti, grandma. None except Akant had any soft corner for Moti despite knowing him for so long.
I was working with Nithin Medam that day and this person too is a dog lover.
He is like 22 years old. When he asked his dad if he could get a dog, his father said, "you are only one dog".
So Nithin raised a white coat Indie Pariah in the street.

I am not having a good picture of Moti, but I would later share his pictures that I have with you in another post.
It is practically impossible for me cover every aspect of Moti's time with me without toying with my emotions but let me still give you an objective view of how much cost Moti's healthcare incurred to me.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcClw-TKbSFo-9c-wMvTg5K_f_gvX95EOEhR_TJ48l0w14cGRcYr6bQspFo06cFDN7C8Vdg28A3kk_46AEdALwiiwx6UkZ5nWes44DS3UBFW_tP8bbZRC1OXYHQoehcZC3ij7mXGefhT-Zv3D8CIckzAjsoSM7Exmc3DR3hEZrORnNHItf_bQZ2Iv1IQ/s671/expenses%20on%20moti.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="600" data-original-height="533" data-original-width="671" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcClw-TKbSFo-9c-wMvTg5K_f_gvX95EOEhR_TJ48l0w14cGRcYr6bQspFo06cFDN7C8Vdg28A3kk_46AEdALwiiwx6UkZ5nWes44DS3UBFW_tP8bbZRC1OXYHQoehcZC3ij7mXGefhT-Zv3D8CIckzAjsoSM7Exmc3DR3hEZrORnNHItf_bQZ2Iv1IQ/s600/expenses%20on%20moti.png"/></a></div>

To conclude, I would say: 
Dogs have needs. Moti did too. He needed time, money, love, and people for his good upbringing. I had none of these to offer him.
The biggest mistake was not putting him in an early training school where they teach (speaking at a very high level) the puppies how to communicate things to their dog parents.
If you are going to adopt a dog, it is a matter of about a decade and that dog training of about 3 months is not an expense, it is an investment.
