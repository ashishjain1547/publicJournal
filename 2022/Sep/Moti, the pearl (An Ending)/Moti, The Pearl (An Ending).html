I am not able to sleep at times at night and thoughts of Moti are overwhelming me on those nights.
At times, I am in deep pain with the thoughts of his well being but all I can do is channel my emotions out through writing.
I was doing okay in Tri Nagar before mom made life difficult through her incessant talking and commentary.
I bought a house and moved away from mom and hence Moti.
I had no problem bearing Moti's expenses before I took the 48 lac home loan for my flat in Gurugram.

The situation became worse once I moved in my new flat leaving Moti behind with mom in Tri Nagar.
Mom was feeding Moti with plain and dry Roti.
Moti was just entering his age of puberty. Also, he was developing health issues.
Dog puberty is the period between sexual maturity and social maturity and can happen between around seven months to almost two years, depending on the breed (larger breeds take longer to develop).
He had itching teeth and gums so he was biting into the corners of the walls and furniture.
He would start humping on getting excited whether it was a human support, another dog or an object.
He would also bite into the wires such as that of my ear phones (twice), of submersible water motor (twice) that resulted in the fall of the electrical box from the shelf and it's parts had come out.
In Tri Nagar, there were also complaints from neighbors that Moti was a trouble for their kids. Moti was a bit quick to bite people.
Hence, around (after) first of September, mom brought Moti to Gurugram with her.

There were various aspects about Moti's life such as how was Moti impacting my personal life, my professional life and my life as being part of a society, now Mapsko Mountville. Then there is this aspect about how Moti must have felt being thrown out of his home on to road next to a garbage dump by his own dog parent. Nothing is sadder than this.
I would definitely face a criminal sentence in the canine law court, if there was one, for my actions against Moti.

While Moti was with me in the first two - three weeks of September, I had lost track of time. Moti required to be taken outside for pooping and walks early around 6:30 AM, then again around like 7:30 PM - 8 PM. My project was an MVP project that was in critical stage and was nearing deadlines which if violated would result in project going outside Infosys. I was hearing complaints from my neighborhood lady in H2501 (RB's) that Moti was peeing in the common area on the floor and then H2502 resident (Ankit Malik) said there was a lot of stink that the floor smelled like a graveyard. I had to bear all of that. When in Tri Nagar, mom would complain that she cannot take hold of Moti and that Rani's and Malakhan's family treat the dog very badly.

Though there were problems I cannot still justify my own act in my head of pushing Moti out.
But let me still share a story with you taken from the book: "Emotional Intelligence. By: Harvard Business Review."

The story goes like this:

<i><h2>Keep It Honest</h2>

<h3>Carol Bartz is the chairman, president, and CEO of Autodesk, a design software and digital content company in San Rafael, California.</h3>

A friend needed to take a six-month assignment in a different part of the country. She had an ancient, ill, balding but beloved dog that she could not take with her.
Her choices boiled down to boarding the poor animal, at enormous expense, or putting it out of its obvious misery.
Friends said, “Board the dog,” though behind my friend’s back, they ridiculed that option. She asked me what I thought, and I told her, kindly but clearly, that I thought she should have the dog put to sleep rather than spend her money keeping it in an environment where it would be miserable and perhaps die anyway. My friend was furious with me for saying this. She boarded the dog and went away on her assignment. When she returned, the dog was at death’s door and had to be put to sleep. Not long after that, my friend came around to say thanks.
“You were the only person who told me the truth,” she said. She came to appreciate that I had cared enough to tell her what I thought was best, even if what I said hurt at the time.
That event validated a hunch that has stood me in good stead as I’ve led my company. Empathy and compassion have to be balanced with honesty. I have pulled people into my ofﬁce and told them to deal with certain issues for the sake of themselves and their teams. If they are willing to learn, they will say, “Gee, no one ever told me.” If they are unwilling, they’re not right for this organization. And I must let them go for the sake of the greater good.
