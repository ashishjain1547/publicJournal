<pre>Am having headache and am sleepy. But am awake because I have to prepare for a test. There are certain matters about which I can not talk in a blog because with those matters are attached the clauses of confidentiality and non-disclosure. 

I was having panic anxiety and it still seems to not have gone and I need a way to let out things that are blowing up my mind.

Note that whatever am telling you hereafter is confidential:
I received an email from HR with the subject line "HR Discussion 1". 

Now when I read that heading there were a couple of questions that came into my mind. What is this discussion going to about? 
And since there is this "1" there, how many such discussions are going to be happening.

Now the answers:
#1 Discussion is about some disciplinary actions against me.

#2 This is my guess. From the law of "three strikes", there could be roughly three such discussion if at all I behave normaly in the first two.

I have not conclusively thought about this matter in mind, nor I have a conclusion to make now to end this post. 

But one this I can tell you is that I am feeling better now, a bit more relaxed. And a bit more motivated to study for my test.

There has not been a discussion named "HR Discussion 1" yet. When I had to attend this discussion yesterday, there came mail that said meeting has been postponed and the date has been fixed yet. 

But, and this is a big but: before the call I called Manju buaji and she didn't pick the first time. Three hours later when we spoke I told her my tentative plans that I am going to quit my job. To this she replied that I chop my leg with an axe as much as I want.
For non-Hindi speakers, what my Manju bua meant was an Hindi maxim meaning "to intentionally hurt oneself" as in "hitting oneself in the toe with an axe".

Thank you for reading. </pre>
