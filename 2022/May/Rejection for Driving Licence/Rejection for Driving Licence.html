4 months of practice, 950 KM of distance and 12 accidents later, I failed in the driving license  test for a gearless two-wheeler.

The most interesting of all the accidents was the one that happened when I was on my way to Sarai Kale Khan for my driving license  test and somewhere near central Delhi I was knocked off of the scooter after colliding with a bus. Rim of my front wheel had bore a crack from the accident and got punctured on the spot. It was tubeless tyre and since that accident, I have not gone to the service station for check-up. I got the front wheel fixed by a road-side mechanic who put a tube around my rim and a patch for the cut that had appeared in the tyre.

<b>Accident # 20220421 1800</b>

After buying fruits in Talab market from a stall, am taking a sharp U-turn and my scooter rams into the stall at the front. I applied brakes and prevented a fall but people nearby had to help me get back up. They helped pull out the keys to turn off race and ignition.

<b>Accident # 20220422 1100</b>

Moti (my pet bitch) was tied on the front with my hand.
I was driving it to the vaccination center in Azadpur. Roughly 5 KMs from my home in Inderlok.
Moti jumped off from Scooter near Prachin Hanuman Mandir.
I applied sudden brakes and fell down with scooter.

<b>Accident # 20220503 1400</b>

There were three people involved in the accident.
A three-wheeler, a pedestrian and myself.
Any accident is a source traumatic stress.
I am unable to recall whether the three-wheeler already ahead of me or it overtook me from behind before the accident.
What I remember is that a three-wheeler was changing lane from the middle lane to left lane to drop the passenger.
When I tried to overtake it from the left (which was one of my mistakes as overtaking should happen from the right side of the vehicle being overtaken).
Second mistake of mine was that I didn't honk at the three-wheeler before trying to overtake it and request for the driver's permission to overtake.
The mistake of three-wheeler driver was that it was changing lane at a very high speed and without giving indicators.
Now as I try to overtake it from the left, a pedestrian was hit by my scooter and I fell down along with scooter.
I did not get any major injuries but the front display and wind shield of my speedometer broke down.
The pedestrian was first trying to call someone on phone and then he asked to visit a nursing home with him. There I spent Rs 1750 on his treatment.
Ashish Jain: He had got muscular injury in the right arm and a scratch in the left palm.
The doctor at hospital asked it at least several times if the pedestrian wanted to file a police case but pedestrian refused.
Luckily, the pedestrian was also a young man like myself and was able survive and thwart any major happening.
