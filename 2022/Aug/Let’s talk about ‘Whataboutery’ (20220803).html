<!-- Let’s talk about ‘Whataboutery’ -->
<pre>
<i><b>
what·about·ery
[ˌwɒtəˈbaʊtəri]
NOUN
BRITISH
the technique or practice of responding to an accusation or difficult question by making a counter-accusation or raising a different issue. Also called whataboutism.
"all too often, well-intentioned debate descends into whataboutery"    
</b></i>

Whataboutery is a British word used to win an argument by pointing at a flaw in the other person or other party when the other person or other party says something to you.
This post is not about politics, as such it may have seemed from the Heading and Opening line. This post is about my three bua(s).
This post is about those conversations that had happened in the past between:
Manju bua and me, or
Kumkum bua and me, or
(The most recent case) Rekha bua and me.
Let us talk about most recent case first and then about Kumkum bua and then Manju bua. This order is also the reverse chronological order of happening of those conversations when one of the three bua might have passed a comment that can be labeled as whataboutery.

INCIDENT 1: With Rekha bua

The stress of taking a home loan is palpable. I was going through a stress of that kind one day and on the night of that day, I receive a call from Rekha bua. When I told what I was stressed about, she said, “that’s very normal to take a home loan for buying house. Even your Rajeev fufaji is paying EMI for home loan to this date.
According to her: I should not bother about home loan because her husband is also paying home loan. 

Also, when I asked Rajeev fufaji if he could help me monetarily, he said: I have retired. My loan taking capacity is zero because I have no salary. And then, I have refinance the house.

INCIDENT 2: With Kumkum bua
The stress of facing rejection after rejection from match after match for marriage proposal is a big deal for me. The absence of a property / house in my own name was a deal breaker since the time I received my first match in the name of Mansi Jain in 2019.
This time in 2022, am still a bachelor and the person who called me was my eldest bua. She called me (or maybe I called her, not sure) and said, “Don’t worry, I would help in fixing a match” and asked for my biodata. Then she went on to passing a comment that goes like this: “I do not understand why you are being impatient and hurrying things when you have an example before you as my son. He is not interested in getting married and he is two years senior than you. I do not know why you are in such a hurry.”
According to her: It is okay for me to remain a bachelor at the age 30 and till the 32 as per Ankur’s case.

INCIDENT 3: With Manju bua
This incident is about a discussion before I had a house in my name and was living on rent in Chandigarh.
The scene goes like this I am sitting in hall of Manju bua’s house and discussing about my marriage and the place where I want to settle.
I raised my concern with her that I am highly unlikely to get a match if I live in a rental accommodation. To this she said, “You should not worry about it. You can have discussion with girl’s family in my house and when I got married, I was also staying in a rental accommodation with your Salil fufaji”.
According to her: It is okay for me to remain in rental accommodation even after marriage as Salil fufaji and she did in the initial days.

To conclude: my life is completely okay because all of troubles in my life are same as a trouble in the life of one or other bua.
