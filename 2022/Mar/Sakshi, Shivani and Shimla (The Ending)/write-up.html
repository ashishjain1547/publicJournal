Arrival:
These folks had picked a hotel prior to coming to Shimla but they changed plans on the last minute to stay in a different (and cheaper) guest house.
I didn't like this change at that moment as to me comfort and good stay were number 1 priority.

First night:
Drinking and smoking in Shivani's room.
Shivani and Dinesh shared one room.
Navjit and Sakshi shared one room.
I was alone and at peace in mine.

Second Night: Hell broke lose.
Drinking and smoking in my room.
The people left the room to me around 4:30 AM.
I went to sleep around 5:30.

Excursion 1: Kufri
Excursion 2: Mall road

Kufri had horse riding, bungee jumping, trail and all. It was something I thought was worth going for. Rs 7000 - 8000 spent there. The sad part was we had opted for six activities but we did not have the stamina to get our count to even three.

Visit to Mall Road was, in my view, a wastage of time. It is a place where you would find a lot of shops but I was not into shopping.
One thing that does come to mind about the Mall Road was the snow fall. I had neven seen snow fall before. And even though it was like tiny white crystal floating with the wind but it was still snow fall. 

<i>Am having sour taste in my mouth about that trip, cannot really appreciate even that deserves a good word or two.</i>

After returning to Chandigarh around 9:30 PM at night, I took the bus to travel to Delhi the same night.
That was also because I was not able to sleep as usual. My head was spinning because of the money I had burnt.

Sakshi and Navit paid their 5K+ contribution.
Shivani never paid her share of the expenses, she never did.

On top of that she was expecting me to buy her iPhone 13 Pro Plus, don't remember what other suffixes were there.
It is 19-Mar-2022 today and even now some 50K amount is pending in my credit card bill.
Even now some 55K amount is pending
Am in a situation about which when one hears shows pity for me. Am ashamed, am disgraced, am a huge disappointment even in my own eyes.
