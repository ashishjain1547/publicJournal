Once I received the handover, I was very excited about moving into my new apartment.
There were a couple of things that I had to figure out at that point in time.
First thing that I had deep thoughts about was "what is the loan repayment plan I have". That question is still unanswered. I am only guessing that my job will pay for it but only I know of how tough life has been at Infosys.

Food is one thing about I didn't have to care because right in the first week of moving in, I was going to meet Moni Singh. My cook.
She would usually seek for lifts from strangers going in the same direction as of Mapsko Mount ville to Rampura chowk in the evening and from Rampura chowk to Mount Ville in the morning.
When she spread out her hand to seek lift from me that evening, I ended up offering her the job of cook at my flat.
I never had to care about food.
The first month was spent largely on getting my things together.
I was on bench till the mid of August. Then I joined an MVP project. MVP is Most Viable Product.
The MVP was completed on time in the one month's time. My role required me to develop a software component they called as Python Converter, which was part of a bigger ETL tool for Merck.
Due to being an MVP project that was nearing deadline, it required me to work on every Saturday. Not that I didn't get a compensatory off but it left mostly tired and bruised as I was under extreme pressure to hold on to project for at least 6 months before I am on bench again.
6 months was a time I had in mind because September is the last month of the year of appraisal cycle.
Me taking on a project should not have appeared like an eye wash to my managers.
The project ended with the MVP deadline by September mid.
I got on a research project after it and even though the work was as I had hoped for. It required that I spend a lot time researching about things that even my managers didn't fully know about.
September was very brutal to me. I had to let go Moti during this month.

Moti might have gone physically, but he will stay in my heart forever.

His chapter was opened again when there was some noise in the Tower H WhatsApp group about a dog being brought down from passenger lift. I shared my posts about Moti in the group then. It was a terrible day. I ended up keeping quiet for mental well-being.
Coming to the financial situation I am in today. My credit card bill (as of 22/Oct/2022, 1:07 am) stood at ₹80,000. I needed to pay an additional ₹10,000 to SBI apart my monthly payment because there was a check bounce at the time of taking the loan.

As of 2022-Nov-6 22:40, my pending SBI home loan payment due to check is done. But the credit card bill stands at: 89,258 INR

That's apart from my monthly payment of ₹34100 and the monthly maintenance of the society.

I got out of H Tower society group on the day (23rd Oct) when there were discussions of doing expenditure on things like newspaper for ground floor lobby, trolly for lift lobby, lockable notice board, lights and chairs in the drivers' waiting room near ground floor lobby, etc. I was completely out of my capacity to stay in that conversation.

I haven't touched the topic of Bhawna in this post because I think of her as a person I spent some time with. Her family refused to take this alliance forward due to financial crunch on my side.
Let me just forget about her and focus on how to come out of debt I am in. Thank you for reading.
