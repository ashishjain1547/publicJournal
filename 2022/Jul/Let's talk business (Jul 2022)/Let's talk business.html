<pre><b><i>Year 2014</i></b>

I had stopped writing into  personal journal due to psychosis episodes associated with the perceived importance of my personal journals, perceived importance of Omicron code and the perception of surveillance.
Did stopping to write journal in Word files help?
Yes.
The way it ended was that I would stop writing journal. Keep one copy with myself. And, give uncle a copy to keep for security and safety reasons.

But it turned out in 2021, neither it was an end of my journal writing, nor an end of surveillance.

What happened between 2014 and 2021 are the following things:

1. I amassed cash to buy a flat by working in the IT sector for two companies.

2. I had set up rental business in Tri Nagar by the help of mom. That's in 2018 after joining Infosys.

3. I had completed my M. Tech in Data Science in 2018 and was writing technology related articles on survival8 blog.

4. In 2014, I had registered the subdomain survival8 on Blogger. In 2017, I had enabled AdSense for my Blog and in 2021, Google paid me 100 USD.

Now after this 7-8 years of struggling, I realise that neither my rental business nor my edTech business is a monopoly and there is huge competition in both the lines.
Also, I am in debt of 48 lacs after buying a flat in Gurugram.

To put more light on my issues, I would elaborate it this way:
Why I cannot charge my clients ₹50,000 per month for a room and have to settle for ₹3000 or ₹4000?

It is because of the other available rental rooms in Tri Nagar area.
Such as in Nirmal Singhal's building, there is room available for as low as ₹3500.

Why cannot I charge my one student something like 3000 or 4000 per month for tuitions?
Because there are people who are teaching for amount as low as Rs 500 in the area, such as Poonam Gupta.

With Google AdSense also the picture is just as gloomy. As of this writing, I am making roughly 3 USD per month.

And now, I would have to agree with a lot of people who want me to focus on my job.
Now, what are people's perception of what I am doing?

I was talking to my cousin Srishti yesterday about the same and according to her, calling Survival8 an Ed tech business or company is highly inappropriate.
She sees it as a personal brand like how YouTubers or Instagram personalities or Twitter users establish themselves as social media personalities.

She also mentioned about tough competition in Ed Tech business.
Srishti mentioned that the blog's name does not resonate with an ed tech business.

But the way I see survival8 is like this:
Google is a subcompany of Alphabet.
Blogger is a subcompany of Google.
And survival8 is a subcompany of Blogger.

Speaking a line about operational costs:
There are zero operational costs associated with survival8.
And the operational costs associated with Tri Nagar's rental business are positive.

Last time when I had been to Mayur Vihar, I had a brief conversation with my uncle and I talked to him about my plans to do rental business, he said, "It is not a business".

Then he asked "are the tenants not paying you rent in a timely manner?".

I did not understand it fully because the way I see it. There is investment, there is revenue, there is documentation, there is client handling, infrastructure management, there is legal work, etc.

Now what's the conclusion:
Do I plan to stop any of it? Do I have an exit plan for rental business. No, never. Do I have an exit plan for ed Tech business? No, though a hesitant one.

Rental business is not only a source of income for me but also for my mother.

Ed Tech business still has to see the light of the day but am optimistic that it might turn out to be a big thing in growing and developing digital country like India.
