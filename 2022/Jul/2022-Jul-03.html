It does not make up an interesting read if I post everyday.
I made a program today as part of teaching Shiva and 6th graders.

I was just about to be on a coffee date with my therapist Shanaya Mishra. 
I was outside Zotails in Patel Nagar and I was checking with her every 5 minutes about where to meet. Finally we agreed to see each other at Rajiv Chowk but we could not.
The scene goes like this I had to meet her at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station but while I was on my scooter on my way to the Metro Station. I receive a call from her and she tells me this:

"Baabu, aaj late ho jayega aur meri mom ka bhi call aa raha hai"
In English: We will get late today, and also my mom has been calling me.
That was the end of the plan for a coffee date.

I had an accident today. I speeding to reach Inderlok metro station from Zakhira and while I reach the underpass, I applied breaks when I was just about to hit another two wheeler (a bike) and in the process, my scooter slid and the right rear-view mirror came off. Its stick is broken now.

I was not about to start journaling again but it just happened yesterday.
I remember a talk with my psychiatrist Tejpal Jindal from one of those scheduled meetings that:

My question was: What are your thought about journaling? What would you recommend about journaling? Does it help?

His answer: Medicines are required in psychiatric cases. Some people enjoy journaling and it is completely okay to write as a hobby.

Signing off.
Thank you for reading.
