Hi folks.
I am writing in a Document Editor after a very long time.
Last time I remember I was writing journal like this was in 2014. That means now is after 8 years.
A couple of differences though:
I am going to be putting this piece of writing online;
This document would be available to anyone who has internet connection.
This is going to be in open.

I don’t think I would have been writing if I did not have sleep issues.

I slept in the morning and part of afternoon.
After that I picked up Natural Language Processing book and refreshed my concepts.
In the evening around 7:30, I was teaching Math to kids from the 73rd street.
There’s Komal who is in fourth and cannot count past 15.
There’s Kusum who knows Multiplication Tables only till 6.
There’s Prince who is in third and cannot recite counting correctly past 15 but can write till 100.
There’s Yash who cannot recite table of 12.
There’s Shiva in sixth class who is struggling with expansion of numbers into Place Values and Face Values.
There is Roshan who is in 7th and is smartest in the class. I need to see his Math book to actually gauge his level of Mathematics.
Basically, what I have here is a bunch of kids with different levels of expertise in areas of Math and I need to teach each one of them.

There is another problem:
Shiva is not paying any fee.
Komal, Kusum and Roshan are siblings and they are paying Rs 500. Because Kusum sometimes cooks for mom and myself. And, Sunita, their mother works as a maid for us. That Rs 500 is adjusted in her pay at the end of the month.
Only people who might pay in real money are Prince and Yash.

The thing is: I just spent Rs 19,500 in buying a Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 for helping these kids learn from only Math content of survival8 and learn by themselves. But the content on survival8 is not that well documented so that the kids can open any web page and immediately pick up what to do with that single page application. Another challenge is these kids do not know English (That’s actually a very, very, very big problem).

I’d close the writing for today. Got to go to sleep. See you tomorrow.
