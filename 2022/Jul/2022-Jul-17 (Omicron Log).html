This is interesting.
Something is different with the font. MS Word had the default font of “Calibri (Body)”, while this LibreOffice Writer has a default font of “Liberation Serif”.

From Wikipedia:

Calibri (/kəˈliːbri/) is a digital sans-serif typeface family in the humanist or modern style. It was designed by Luc(as) de Groot in 2002–2004 and released to the general public in 2007, with Microsoft Office 2007 and Windows Vista. In Office 2007, it replaced Times New Roman as the default typeface in Word and replaced Arial as the default in PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, and WordPad. De Groot described its subtly rounded design as having "a warm and soft character".

Calibri is part of the ClearType Font Collection, a suite of fonts from various designers released with Windows Vista. All start with the letter C to reflect that they were designed to work well with Microsoft's ClearType text rendering system, a text rendering engine designed to make text clearer to read on liquid-crystal display monitors. The other fonts in the same group are Cambria, Candara, Consolas, Constantia and Corbel.

And About “Liberation Serif”:

Liberation is the collective name of four TrueType font families: Liberation Sans, Liberation Sans Narrow, Liberation Serif, and Liberation Mono. These fonts are metrically compatible with the most popular fonts on the Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office software package (Monotype Corporation’s Arial, Arial Narrow, Times New Roman and Courier New, respectively), for which Liberation is intended as a free substitute. The fonts are default in LibreOffice.

Back to writing about my life:

I was at Mapsko MountVille today with mom. I had planned a meeting there with Bhawna Jain’s brother (Prashant) and her mother and father.
Mom liked the apartment. She was all praises when we returned home around 4-5 PM.

We had left for Gurugram on my scooter Maestro Edge around 7 in the morning.

The meeting went well as per preparation that mom and I had done (i.e., nothing). Thanks to the staff at Mapsko.
We had snacks in the Sales office and talk at the Club House.
While we were returning from Gurugram to Inderlok, it was drizzling and it was pretty awesome weather. After an hour of driving, I had to take two pills of Saridon to keep myself awake. There was no tea stall on the National Highway.

Didn’t teach kids today was tired a lot.
Md Nihal has left the tuition because his family thinks he needs to learn more and beyond counting. That’s okay, except he studied with me for roughly a month and I didn’t get paid Rs 400 on 15th from his family as was discussed at the time of his joining.
An example of exploitation in the country (India).

I was posting my journal from 2011 November and Decem	ber online and found some lines about Omicron. Sharing them again here:

2011-Dec-1 (Inception of Omicron)
I was struck with an idea, an idea that took my over 4 and half hours, still counting. It is about creating an online portal that would solve doubts of students and help people learn and earn that way. I discussed it with Srishti a little bit to take feedback and it was helpful. 
The only problem that remains is that website will need an initial investment; otherwise, it would make money through advertising and its educational services.

2011-Dec-8 (Omicron, an idea)
I just write and scan whatever idea I get for an online education portal, it gives me an awesome feeling to think of myself as a creator of a big website yet to be created.

2011-Dec-9 (Discussion with Anu)
I keep telling my ideas to Srishti and, recently, today I was telling it elaborately to Anu. I understood that I just started a topic with a wrong person and that it was surely a waste of time. She simply said that it is useless idea. The reason she gave is that ‘better websites already exist’. My set back was that I hadn’t seen any websites yet. I should do some market research, web research to see what is already there similar to my idea. 

She was repeatedly telling me to take up books and study for falling exams. She is a creepy, actually. I only went to her because there is no one else there after Srishti with whom I could have discussed it only to help myself understand my ideas in a better way and in a way also get some feedback, whatsoever.

Thank you for reading!
