It is 20th Jul 02:18 AM. It was a very bad day. 
There was a fight at home between Dilip Patel (Husband) and Sangita (Wife). They are staying in 75 Ground-Inner. 
Dilip had come home after consuming too much alcohol to make him lose his mind and senses that he was yelling and screaming at Sangita and also beating her for talking back to him in retaliation. 

When the first time Dilip was screaming and yelling, he was in 73 Ground-Inner room, where Rani and Mohan Patel are staying. I asked Rani to make him lower his voice. At this point, Pankaj and Anju were looking down from the Mezzanine floor to check what was it all about, why there was so much yelling and screaming.

I cannot order the events in a very sequential manner but Dilip was beating Sangita whenever he could reach her through his hands. At one point, Sangita was lying on the floor and Dilip was kicking her.

The way I tried to resolve this is by telling Dilip with folded hands to sleep, but he did not listen and fight goes on. Hence: I called the cops. 100. 112. The cops had difficulty locating the whereabouts of our home 1141 in street number 75 in Deva Ram Park. Once I was able to get them to reach the Prachin Hanuman Mandir, I went on my scooter to get them home.

The cop Vijendra Kumar asked what I wanted, after he had suggested that if the tenants are not good then a tenor should remove them. So, I spoke before Vijendra sir that I want both these husband and wife to removed from my house. 
A minute later, Vijendra sir had left it to handle it and I spoke to Dilip that "he should never come home after consuming alcohol". At this point, Vijendra stood up and slapped Dilip telling him that Dilip does not have money eat or feed his family, pay his rent but he has money to spend on alcohol.
Dilip was oggling at the cop and now Vijendra sir took an aggressive stance to get back at Dilip but Rani and Sangita stopped the cop saying, "I do not have anybody other than him. Small fights between husband and wife are very normal and Dilip did not beat me."
Then cop said to me, "If Dilip comes home drunk again, call me immediately."

In the last minute, Akant called on my number and told me that if this kind of ruckus is going to happen again, he would vacate within five days.

I did not have any temptations to spend time writing this post but I cannot sleep at times and picking up the laptop to write journal looks like last resort.

Thank you for reading.
I do not care if any tenant stays or goes.
Anju and Pankaj (73rd street, Mezzanine floor) are leaving.
Akant and Kanchan (75th street, Mezzanine floor) might leave.
Am not sure about Rani and Mohan (73rd street, Ground floor, Inner room).
Now, probably I would have find new tenants.

See you soon.
Thank you. Bye.
