<pre>2022-Jul-07

Am both excited and nervous but with a tint of sadness.
I was at the bank today. To foreclose my 15 lac personal loan and get a home loan for my new apartment worth 88.5 lac INR.

Do you know what music I am listening to right now?
It is “Burn it down by Linkin Park”. Music affects your thoughts and mood so it is a good thing that am letting you know this.

ICICI bank loan personnel told me that I could get a loan of roughly between 40-50 lac. He was zeroing down around 45 lac.

I reached home and met Renu Jain, the principal from the school next door (Mahavir International School) to discuss my of expanding my own education business of online and offline teaching.
She told to come to her on the weekend (Saturday) on the day of Parent Teacher Meeting. It could be a good start that I fund my dreams myself. 

Then I was on calls with Gita Chhabra (from Mapsko) and Amit Sharma (from SBI) to lend me the necessary amount so I could pay the 100% of the property amount.

Tomorrow I will hear from Amit about my loan application status. It is an exciting moment. I will have my house.
I am nervous because the situation is still iffy.

Now why I am sad?
When I was the ICICI bank, the bank personnel Santosh Kumar told me that I could get the rental earning directly in my bank account and produce the rent agreements so my need of 55 lac (6 lac for registry of the property) could be met. I called Srishti to ask if I could get 10 lac from her. She said the request should come via grandma and I should tell her about property by coming to Mayur Vihar.
I called Manju bua for rent agreements, she didn’t pick and disconnected the ringing phone. Same with Kumkum bua, she too disconnected my call while it was still ringing.

I could be in a big mess tomorrow or I would sail through and past all these haters and have the property in my name.

Thank you for reading.
