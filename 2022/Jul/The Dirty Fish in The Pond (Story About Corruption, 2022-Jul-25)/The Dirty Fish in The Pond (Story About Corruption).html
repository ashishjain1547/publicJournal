<pre>The title you are seeing above came in my mind after doing a lot of thinking.
Basically what happened is an incident of corruption.
It is about an episode when a cop sought for money for a service that's free otherwise.

I don't think that one man's illegitimate demand for money should render the image of police corrupt in the eyes of entire public.
I have had instances when I have been helped by police in getting breakthrough in an otherwise tough situation with another person.
The one major problem with current reporting system or FIR system of police is that you cannot report an incident just at any police station but only at the police station of the district where incident happened.

The rule was later changed after the 2013 Delhi Rape Case through the introduction of the concept of 'Zero FIR' for criminal acts.

The incident for which I am writing this post happened with me a couple of days back at the Keshav Puram police station.

I had gone there for submitting the police verification form for tenant Rani Devi.
The person sitting behind the desk inside the 'Record Room' was not wearing a police uniform but was responsible for accepting the forms.
The colloquial saying that goes about government documentation held true here as well. The maxim I am talking about is "You can never submit a government document in only one visit at the office, as there are always one or the other issue that official accepting the document will highlight."

I had also come here earlier in the morning and at that time the lady officer said the form should have two photographs of the tenant. You should be carrying the original ID card of the tenant. You should have three copies of the form and ID proof with you. And, the forms are submitted between 4PM to 6PM.

In the evening when I returned I had everything except for the hundred rupees cash that the office holder was asking for accepting the forms.

He explained his need for it by calling it "kharcha paani". He went on to ask me about the rental property and other details, about my job, family etc. Then said "we have a fixed salary unlike in private sector where your salary is revised depending on the work that you do and performance. I have no benefit of putting in extra effort or working hard."

At that point in time, I agreed with him saying that "yeah, government services should not be free otherwise people get into exploiting those resources like how Arvind Kejriwal has put the habit of taking free water and electricity in the public."
