There is this thing about people. They do that what they want to do. First thing is they never change (like my uncle Yashvir), second thing is when they change, they change with the generation (again like my uncle Yashvir).

But this post is not about him. 
I am upset because am feeling like abandoned by my Manju bua though I have had plenty of negative experiences with her. Manju bua keeps exiting my “Journal” group on WhatsApp.

I really feel like an adamant child while complaining like this in the above lines.

The thing is: I need to go to sleep but facing issues with sleep and managing anxiety.

There is a tenant: Pankaj Shukla and Anju Shukla who have not paid rent for this month till now.
We had known it from some source that this couple has not paid rent of their previous tenor. Today, Anju acknowledged it with pride saying:
“Hum toh bol hi rahe hai ye baat”
In English: “We are already telling this thing to you.”

This effectively means they do not have the money.
Wait a second.
Let me make a list:
1. They have not paid rent of previous tenor.
2. They are under debt. (As claimed by Anju again when I told about my debt.)
3. They paid me rent of Rs 3500 in parts on different days in 20 rupee notes last month.
4. This month they have not paid rent till now and are telling me that they might leave if certain issues like Municipal Corporation water issue is not fixed.

I have told Manju bua about this but she is angry with me and does not seem interested. 
But now my some people in my family (if not everyone) might know this in case they read my blog.

Thank you reader. I owe you a lot. Thank you for this one more night’s restful sleep.
