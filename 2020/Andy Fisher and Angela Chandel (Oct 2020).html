<pre>Do you know what I like in Andy Fisher and Rohit Sud? They both make me laugh. This time am going to share a joke with you that Andy Fisher made back in the month of October, 2020.
Angela Chadel is truly an angel from the first sight.
She has fair complexion, round face like that of plastic dolls that you would have seen with infants in India. In America, they have Barbie dolls, if Angela were like that it would have been a dream. 
Angela is short and chubby. She speaks softly and magic sauce to her being attractive is that she is a psychologist.
Now it is not one joke that I would like to share about Psychologists, there are many. The first one was from Andy Fisher, rest were from others.
Dr Shashi Sethi was herself kind of a joke when think of a statement she made about my life.

Dr Shashi told me that "I have everything in 'roti, kapda and makaan', everything but sex. Leaving sex apart, there is hardly anything missing.
But when I think about it, she was wrong, because according to some people like Andy Fisher and Rohit Sud, sex is THE thing. Yes, in capitals.

And also, I had a huge temptation to correct her that today, it isn't 'food, clothing and shelter' but 'a job, car keys and an apartment', which I didn't have.

Coming back to that joke I was going to tell you. When I told Andy Fisher that I am seeing a hot psychologist, he told me that he can do a much better counselling of mine without any fee. Not just that, he has been doing my counselling all along. Plus, (here comes the joke) he would open a shop right in front of her shop and do counselling in half the price and as an additional aid, he would provide the ₹10 pornographic CD to the people who would come to him.
Then he asks how much Angela charges and quotes half of that price at ₹250.

The next few remarks are from my psychiatrist. I asked him if he could refer me to a counselor and he said "you are much more qualified than any counselor". Then he goes on to tell me that I don't need any counseling as I am smart man, counseling is for those people whose girlfriends have left them or there had been some death in their families and they have quit their jobs, have become alcoholics and have gone into temporary depression for some external reason.

Then he asks if he would send Rahul Gandhi to Angela, would she be able to fix him? No, because counselling does bring any change in the underlying personality of a person.
Now, god only knows who's right and who's wrong but this blog for the time being is an excellent medium for me let it out what's inside my head.
Thank you for reading.
See you in the next post.

PS: These days (in Feb 2022) Rohit Sud is my lawyer-cum-advisor-cum-friend.</pre>
