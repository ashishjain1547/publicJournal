<pre>Human brain is an expert device in finding patterns. Whether this pattern is of repeating color combinations or of repeating occurrences of a car.
The more frequent the occurrences, the stronger the pattern.
One such pattern that is now deeply embedded in my brain is of khaki color and black color.
The origins of the memory imprints of this color combination come from Swati Tandon (B1 block, flat no. 13, Manu Apartments, Mayur Vihar, Phase 1, Delhi).

This was in Sep/Oct/Nov of year 2012. I was in the elevator with Swati Tandon that evening when she was wearing that low neck  revealing black dress. The only color visible on her apart from the black color was the skin color.
But today I realize that "categorization of color based purely on her skin" was an extremely wrong generalization.
But alas, I am at a loss of  words even today when it comes to that light shade of brown.
Best I have been able to describe that light shade of brown is from the memories of an outfit of that color along with a black outfit. Hence, the word "khaki" brown color. 
Well, brown is still important here because khaki shades of grey are also common.

Again after near the end December or early days of January in 2013, I again saw instances of these two colors.
In December on Swati Tandon when she was going upstairs with her father. She was wearing a brown overcoat and something black for the legs.
In January, it was on Veena Ralli. She was wearing a obnoxious looking plain and very tight sweater of a light shade of brown. For the legs, her overflowing black salwar suit was visible.
Now, it didn't end there. I would repeatedly come to see the occurrences of this khaki brown shade at places and I would be trying to categories it using the perfect word.
Whether in: skin brown and black (on people in clothes).
Or tea brown and the color of the night (something I relate to).
Or mud brown and the black (as in Alto car of Tanuja Nautiyal, chemistry teacher at ADGITM).
The thing about all this categorization of colors or of face features with the person the face features best match with comes with very blurry lines of correctness. For example, let me show you images if some people from the internet.
Now it is upto you to decide whether the person in the image is actually that person or not. Whether the images are of the same person or not. Totally upto you. 
To err is to be human. Thank you.

<h1>A word about psychological background of categorization activity that happen in human brain...</h1>

Following excerpt is taken from the book:

<b>Maps of Meaning. The Architecture of Belief (Jordan B. Peterson, 1999)</b>

It is impossible to properly appreciate the nature of the categories of the mythological imagination without some understanding of the process of categorization. The act of categorization enables us to treat the mysterious and complex world we inhabit as if it were simpler—as if it were, in fact, comprehensible. We perform this act of simplification by treating objects or situations that share some aspect of structure, function or implication as if they were identical. People are very good at categorizing— so good, in fact, that the ability is taken for granted and appears simple. It is not so simple, however. Neither the “rules” that underly categorization, nor the act itself, have proved easy to describe. Roger Brown, the eminent psycholinguist, states:

<i>Until about 1973, psychological experiments on category formation conceived of human categories on the model of a “proper set.” Triangles are a proper set, which means that members of the triangle class are precisely definable in terms of a conjunction of attributes true of all members of the set, and of no nonmembers. A triangle is a closed three- sided figure. From the fact that a clear definition exists, it follows that membership in the set is not a matter of degree; one triangle is no more essentially triangular than any other. An entity either is or is not a triangle.
In retrospect, it is amazing that psychology was for so long able to think of real-life categories as proper sets. We ought to have worred more over the extreme difficulty everyone has in defining anything “natural,” and natural, as used here, includes not only dogs and carrots but also artifacts like chairs, cars, and pencils. I know you can tell one when you see one, but just try listing the attributes that are true of all dogs and of no cats or wolves or hyenas, or of all the carrots and no radishes or turnips, or of all chairs and no small tables, hassocks, benches or slings.</i>

In the natural state, so to speak, human beings do not think like logicians or even like empiricists. It takes training to think like that. In the absence of such training, we still think, however; but more subjectively—like “unreasonable,” idiosyncratically emotional beings, who inhabit bodies of particular size, with particular and constrained properties.
Our natural categories, which are the groupings we generate spontaneously, do not consist solely of the consensually apprehensible properties shared by the things and situations we encounter. Neither are natural categories tightly bounded; their borders are fuzzy, and they overlap. The construction of proper sets is possible—obviously, sinceMaps of meaning they exist—and the ability to construct and use such sets has proved useful, in a broad variety of manners. Nonetheless, the capability that underlies such construction appears relatively new, phylogenetically speaking, and seems dependent at least in part on the ability to think empirically and to regard things objectively. In the absence of such ability—which requires specialized training (or, at least, immersion in a culture like ours where such thinking has become commonplace) people naturally incline toward the development of what has been described (recently) as the “cognitive model.” Cognitive models are characterized by a number of distinctive properties (as paraphrased, in part, from George Lakoff201):

1) They are <b>embodied</b> with regard to their content, which essentially means that they can be used, without necessarily being defined; are implicit in action, without necessarily being explicit in description. Two things classified within the same cognitive model are two things that evoke the same behavior, and can therefore be regarded, at least from the perspective of action, as one thing. If you are utilizing a cognitive model, and someone asks you to describe its content (“What makes a dog?”), you might say, “I can’t say, but I know when one is around.” You know that a dog is, for example, something friendly, something to be petted, and something to play with—although such knowledge does not constitute everything that makes up what you regard as dog. Most of the concepts you use are in fact embodied, at the most basic of levels—are habitual, procedural, motoric, behavioral. You can use them without thinking. Those that are not can only be applied slowly, with full conscious attention, and with effort.

2) They are characterized by <b>basic-level categorization</b> and <b>basic-level primacy</b>. These terms mean, respectively, that the phenomena most “naturally” apprehensible to the human mind—perceptible as a whole, or gestalt; nameable, communicable, manipulable, memorable—serve as the material for initial categorization, and that those initial categories provide the basis for the development of more abstract concepts (even for the comparison point for determining what we consider abstract). “Most naturally apprehensible” means learned and named first (generally with short names) and conceptualized at the level of distinctive action, (in association with such characteristic behaviors as petting for the category “cat” and smelling for the category “flower”). Our basic-level categories reflect our structure, as much as the structure of the external world: we most accurately conceive of those things that most simply present themselves to us.
The “higher” and “lower” levels of category that surround these naturally apprehensible basic-level phenomena might be regarded, in contrast, as “achievements of the imagination,” to use Roger Brown’s phrase. We perceive the “cat,” for example, and infer the species that contains the cat or the subtype that makes it Siamese. Our basic- level categories generally occupy the middle of our conceptual hierarchies: we generalize when we move “up,” and specialize when we move “down.”

3) They may be used in <b>metonymic</b> or <b>reference-point</b> reasoning. Metonymic reasoning is <b>symbolic</b>, in the psychoanalytic or literary sense. Metonymic means interchangeable and more. The fact that objects in a cognitive model have metonymic properties means that any or all of those objects can stand for any or all of the others.
This capacity makes sense, since all of the objects in a given category are by definition regarded as equivalent, in some nontrivial sense (most generally, in terms of <b>implication for action</b>  ). The human capacity for metaphor, aesthetic appreciation and allusion seemsMaps of Meaning integrally related to the capacity for metonymic reasoning and the use of richly meaningful cognitive models.

4) They are characterized by <b>membership</b> and <b>centrality gradience</b>. Membership gradience implies degree of membership, which is to say that an ostrich, for example, is a bird, but perhaps not so much of a bird as a robin—because the robin has more properties that are central to the category bird. A thing can be a better or worse exemplar of its category; if it is worse, it can still be placed within that category.

5) They contain phenomena associated as a consequence of <b>familial resemblance</b>, a term used first in this context by Ludwig Wittgenstein. Things with familial resemblance all share similarities with a potentially hypothetical object. The prototypical Smith brother, to use a famous example, may have a dark mustache, beady eyes, balding pate, thick hornrimmed glasses, dark beard, skinny neck, large ears and weak chin. Perhaps there are six Smith brothers, in total, none of whom has all the properties of the prototypical Smith. Morgan Smith has a weak chin, large ears, balding pate and skinny neck—but no glasses, mustache, or beard. Terry, by contrast, has the glasses, mustache and beard—but a full head of hair, small ears and a normal neck. Nelson has a receding hairline, beady eyes, and a dark beard and mustache—and so on for Lance, Randy and Lyle. None of the brothers precisely resembles another, but if you saw them in a group, you would say, “those men are all related.”

6) They give rise to the phenomenon of <b>polysemy</b>, a defining characteristic of myth. A polysemic story is written and can be read validly on many levels. The phenomenon of polysemy, discussed in some detail later in this book, arises when the relationship of objects within a particular cognitive model is analogous in some sense to the relationship that obtains between cognitive models. Great works of literature are always polysemic, in this manner: the characters within the story stand in the same relationship to one another as things of more general significance stand to one another, in the broader world. The struggle of Moses against the Egyptian pharaoh, for example, to take a story we will consider later, can also be read as an allegory of the struggle of the oppressed against the oppressor or, even more generally, as the rebellion of the [world-destroying (flooding)] savior against society.

To say that two separable things belong to the same category is a tricky business. We presume, without thinking, that we group things as a consequence of something about them, rather than as a consequence of something about us. What do all chairs share in common, then? Any given chair may lack some of the most common chair attributes, such as legs, backs or armrests. Is a tree-stump a chair? Yes, if you can sit on it. It isn’t really something about an object, considered as an independent thing, that makes it a chair: it is, rather, something about its potential for interaction with us. The category “chair” contains objects that serve a function we value. Chairs may be efficiently sat upon—at least potentially. Our action in the face of an object constitutes an elementary but fundamental form of classification (constitutes, in fact, the most fundamental of all classifications; the classification from which all abstracted divisions are derived). The category of “all things that make you want to run away when you look at them” might be considered, for example, a very basic form of construct. Closely related to this category, although slightly higher in the hierarchy of abstraction, might be the category of “all objects to be feared,” or “all objects that are dangerous when approached in one fashion but beneficial when approached in another.”

It is a meaningful but “irrational” classification scheme of this sort that Jung described as a complex—one of the constituent elements of the “collective unconscious.” A complex is, in part, a group of phenomena, linked together because of shared significance [which is (essentially) implication for action, or emotional equivalence]. Jung believed that many complexes had an archetypal (or universal) basis, rooted in biology, and that this rooting had something specifically to do with memory. It appears that the truth is somewhat more complicated. <b>We classify things according to the way they appear, the way they act, and in accordance with their significance to us, which is an indication of how to act in their presence—and may mix any or all of these attributes, irrationally (but meaningfully), in a single scheme. We categorize diverse things in similar manners, across cultures, because we share perceptual apparatus, motivational drive and emotional state, as well as structure of memory and physical form, manifested in observable behavior. The imagination has its natural categories, dependent for their existence on the interaction between our embodied minds and the world of shared experience; into these categories fall particular phenomena in a more or less predictable manner. Stories describe the interactions of the contents of the categories of the imagination, which take embodied form, in the shape of dramatic characters. The characters have a predictable nature, and play out their relationships in an eternally fascinating patterned fashion, time and time again, everywhere in the world.</b>
