<pre>Who is Naresh Taneja and what are sticky memories?
Naresh Taneja is the (or maybe 'was the' if he was dead) richest man in the society of Manu Apartments.
His complete address is:
B1 block, flat no: 30, Manu Apartments, Mayur Vihar, Ph 1, Delhi
Now what do I have to do with him? Or what did I have to do with him?
The answer to both of these questions is nothing. Except for one thing that I think he is one who is responsible for the memories that I have of him.
One might ask like what memories?
These memories or imprints are from the year 2012 which was when the surveillance team first let me know of their presence and wreaked havoc in brain.
I have neither spoken with or met with Naresh Taneja personally but by the looks of his face he seems to be both a smoker and drinker.
His eyes had deep dark circles and his face was very wrinkled and his complexion was dark.
He always had his hair nicely combed. He used to carry a handbag with him under arm that's folded at the elbow so the handbag is close the abdomen.
One more thing he was always accompanied by his driver. I never thought I would think of his driver one day so never bothered too much about his name.
And Naresh Taneja always wore dark suit. Royal blue.
Luckily, I have just found a picture of him from the LinkedIn. Here's that:

Let's start with recollecting the memories...

Here's one:

7:30 PM

A winter evening in the month of December or January.

Naresh Taneja and his wife Pramod Taneja are returning from somewhere. Probably some occasion or event (another guess work imprinted along with the memory).
Am noticing this scene from 7-12 meters from the B1 car parking.
Now you would not be able to guess what I believe I saw next.
Silhouette figure of a woman I think to be Anshu mam from ADGITM (aka NIEC). 
And another person with these three is Rishi Taneja himself or his brother. Not sure.
That's the end of first memory.
Now it definitely looks like a plot from a thriller novel. Like a starting point of some suspense story but you would be wrong to think that.
This is just a memory with no background or a foreground. With no starting and no ending. It is an imprint in my mind.
And let me add a bit of more information and make this static image a seconds long clip.
Naresh Taneja looks back to people coming after him, viz. Anshu and the man to tell something to them. 
Why is this extra bit of information important? It makes me connect the four of them to form one entity or group and makes me relate Naresh Taneja with Anshu mam.</pre>
