Negotiating is not easy. It is not a game for everyone. Yet even massage therapists play it very well. That does not mean that what they do to get their terms  accepted or to get the deal is right but still that's what they do repeatedly and probably with almost every client.

The story started in the month of January in 2022.

Before I start my rants about Anandam, let me take you through a nearly ideally functioning spa, The Tenzin Tibetan Spa.
The spa is located on the outskirts of Chandigarh in area MDC 5, Panchkula.
The first thing that you might notice about the spa if you would enquire on call is that the place offers no special services like topless handjob or body to body.
And the owner of the spa Tenzin Migstam boasts about running a spa that is a center for therapy rather than a place for sex trade.
The second point of difference that is not overtly visible is that the therapists at Tenzin Tibetan Spa actually receive salaries.

You need to visit both. A spa like Tenzin Tibetan Spa and a spa like Annandam to notice this difference. The masseuse at Tenzin Tibetan Spa would not ask for tip.

Now the thing about Annadam is that what you get here is not a therapy but a very scripted sequence of touching and pressing such that this sequence would end in about 20-25 minutes and after that the masseuse will pitch the extra services to you.

Masseuse will ask you 'sir, aap extra services lenge?' 
To which I usually ask 'extra services me kya kya h?'

She would go on, 'topless handjob, body to body. Sir aap kya lenge'. 

To this I would enquire 'body to body ke kya charges h?' 

There was a time when answer to this was ₹3000. That was in 2022.

As of 2023, the therapists now would quote ₹4000 for body to body and ₹2000 for topless handjob.
The whole point a person comes to a spa is to relax and rejuvenate.
But that relaxation and rejuvenation comes at a very high price.

If you are a hard bargainer or I say a tough negotiator you may be able grill these masseuse and bring down their prices to as low as just hand job with touching for ₹500.

Amid this negotiation, the masseuse here at Anandam would ask to take a restroom break or water break. During this break, my best guess and experience tells me that masseuse goes to the front desk to tell Sanjay, or the lady manager about deal details and in what stage the negotiation process is. The masseuse probably consults at the front desk about how should she treat the client at this point, whether she should accept the deal or reject it.

You would have to be creative in what you say, what you ask the masseuse to make her think clearly of your constraints, budget, needs and demands. The way I put it is this way, "what is available for ₹500?"
"I don't have that kind of money."

Then there is a very special question that I learnt during my Mapsko Mountville flat deal. This question was raised to me by Yogesh Gautam. He asked me how did I estimate the flat's worth to be 80 lacs or 85 lacs.

If I would raise this question back to masseuse who is offering the service that how did she figure out that the extra service was worth ₹2000 or ₹4000, she would promptly answer that 'that is because she is already in this business and she know what are the current rates.

But mind that the experience of grilling them is mutual. Negotiation is a tough job for the inexperienced. It requires a lot of planning, a lot of creativity in crafting a deal, proposing that deal to the other side, a lot of control on your thoughts, emotions, on words you speak and words you don't speak.

At the end of the day, the way situation might turn out to be in your favor like this: she gives you a rough, namesake handjob for 500 bucks and leaves. 
Or she accepts some amount like 2500 - 3000 Rupees and gives you a body to body massage but would still cut corners in terms of time or extra cushy treatment you were thinking you would get.

The point I am trying to make is: 
In life, you don't get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.
