<i>That's Moti on 19th March, 2022.</i>

<pre>Dear master
Hope you are doing well. 
Been a long time since you left me on that street in Nimri colony.
It hurts what happened with me, what you did but let's accept it as past now. Water under the bridge. I have travelled far and away from the dump where you left me in search of you and that too probably in the wrong direction.
It is a bit of relief to know that you came looking for me. Sad that you couldn't find me. It is okay, let's accept it as my fate. I still do not know or understand what wrongs I might have done that you had to let me go.
Well, now I have ended up like million other dogs on the streets of India, and probably other countries too. Every time I think of you the sad memories of our separation comes to my mind.

It has been over four months since you and I separated.
Today as I think back and write to you, there is no pain but just sadness.
And I do wish to know how you are? How things have changed since I am gone? But I can't ask you anything anymore now that I don't have an address. I hope you understand what that feels like, and what that means.

I would like to go look for food now. Haven't had a decent meal in past couple of days.

Yours Sincerely
Moti </pre>
