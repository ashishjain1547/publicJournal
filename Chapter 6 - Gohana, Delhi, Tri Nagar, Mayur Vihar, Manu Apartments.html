<h3>Delhi and Tri Nagar</h3>

Delhi in comparison to this Manu Apartments society or any other society in this area has fared much better in terms of my expectations as it turned out to be much faster in its overall development.

The thing I noticed about Delhi is its greenery, cleanliness, lesser slums, the wide roads, the flyovers (now they are everywhere in Delhi), Metro connectivity, and the visible crowd of Delhi (yes, that has changed too). Delhi has come a long way and it still has a long way to go. Thanks to Arvind Kejriwal.

The changes that I saw in Tri Nagar were:

- The roadside trash block had been closed and turned into an office for some government official. This led to major reduction in cows and dogs and litter in this area.

- The factories had been moved out from the Tri Nagar to some remote areas of Delhi such as Bawana district of North West Delhi. This led to a change of the tenant crowd here. The factory workers had moved out from Tri Nagar to locations near-by the factories.

- Street lights had been installed in the streets (at least in the streets near to my house). These street lights are very compact in size and very bright, thanks to the technological advancements.

- CCTV cameras had been installed in the streets (at least in the streets near to my house).

<h3>Manu Apartments</h3>

Mavilla apartments (society on the left Manu apartments, on right it is Maitri) put up silver-jubilee banner, society was 25 years old (1987-2012).
As amma tells, the cost of the flat in Manu Apartments had come up to be 4 Lacs (0.4 million INR). That should be the cost to investor buyers.

30-40 years ago: grandpa had registered in the court with a person for the land for the lawyers for some R200 and since then they had be giving the installments as were required until the flats were ready. He got lucky in the draw and got the first flat, the flat number one.

The flat now stood at 15 million INR as the base value for the owners. Otherwise, its present let-out sale price for a buyer will be over 30 million. That is 90 times the investment value for the flat 25 years ago.

<h3>16-Dec-2001, Sunday</h3>

We had organized lunch for the society and also invited our family’s professional contacts. It was on the occasion of us shifting here in Manu. Though, we had moved here back in March after the completion of examination of us, the kids, in our old schools, we waited until December for throwing a party. According to a note found in the documents kept by grandpa, the cost of the function was over 23000 for the record, but it had come close to Rs 30000 on including the indirect and supportive expenses.

<h3>Manu Apartments in 2021</h3>

Manu Apartments is a society in East Delhi. The location of this society is at a walking distance of 5 to 10 minutes from the metro station and about 15-20 minutes from the Akshardham temple. The Mayur Vihar phase-1 station became an intersection on 31 December 2018. I realized it in December 2020 because I never had to use the Metro so much since moving to Chandigarh. When I was traveling in the metro Pink line in the December, I saw that Delhi has seen a lot of developments since the time I had seen it before.

Now, the thing about Manu apartments is that it is a society where if each flat costs about 7.3 crores INR (in Feb 2021) then each member of that society should be at least a millionaire in USD terms. The prices of flats would vary as there are seven A blocks, three B blocks and one C block with A being the cheapest and C being the costliest.

The calamity is that residents of this society don't have space to park their cars now. The management committee of the society drew the policy that only two cars can be parked inside the society and now people park their cars on the foot walk outside the society gate. It is a complete ridiculous sight if you ever get to go from outside this society.
