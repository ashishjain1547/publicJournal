The idea of starting a rental business was beyond my wildest imaginations.
The main challenge would have been getting people to accept the challenges of a rental business and if it were my initiative, the first challenge would have been mom herself.

Mom learnt of a prospective tenant from our neighbour Mrs Poonam and tenant and tenant's family were ready to move in to the room I was staying in. The grandpa's room.

The tenant's three kids were taking tuition from Mrs Poonam and hence the selection of our house as a place to live.

When I had stayed in Tri Nagar in the summers till August, I had cleared a lot of clutter from granny's room and realigned furniture in grandpa's room.
Sham was staying in the room above mom's. The roof in granny's room and hall to mom's room had fallen down long back. There was no way to room above grandpa's room.
In summers of 2019, I got the roof of two rooms fixed in an expense of about 75000 INR. This was supposed to make the place livable.
In the fall of 2019, mom flooded the house with tenants in every room due to which I had to intervene and had to hear from badi buaji.

At that point in time, the house was less of a house and more of a rooster coop.

12 people, 4 rooms and 1 restroom.

Limited water supply.

I had taken a trip to Delhi from Chandigarh on one weekend to assess the situation and it was a bad feeling that I got on seeing the place this crowded.

Later from the help of Manju bua and Kumkum bua, we asked few tenants to vacate from granny's hall and Manju bua's room above. This stabilized the situation for the time being and from there the business goes on.
