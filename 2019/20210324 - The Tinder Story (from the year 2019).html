<pre class="">Do you know that a Tinder subscription for one year costs lesser than Toastmasters Club subscription for six months?
Not sure about today but that was the situation back in April 2019. <span class="" style="display: none;">In April 2019 Tinder Gold subscription had been priced at some 4K bucks while Toastmasters membership was for about 4500 INR or so in equivalent USD terms.</span>

Tinder didnâ€™t help me find a girl but it did help me find myself. Apart from the fact that the app connects you with women, it was a great experience for me for multiple reasons.
Reason #1: if I hadnâ€™t used Tinder, I wouldnâ€™t have been here talking about it, haha ðŸ˜‚
The story goes like this. Joining Tinder was my reaction to a rejection of marriage proposal.

If I would start about the reason for rejection it would take up the space for an altogether new post but in short: it was because of last name (or cast).

People do desperate things to comfort themselves or seek pleasure. Getting a Tinder subscription was my desperate act to overcome the loneliness in my life, to fill some colors into my otherwise colorless life.

I knew what this app was about because I had used itâ€™s free subscription a year or two before. When I first explored the dating apps, I had also tried OkCupid and some other apps such as Kik <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kik.android&hl=en_IN&gl=US" target="_blank" class="">[Ref]</a>. Let's not get into that also because (in short) the profiles were not genuine there. 

The number one plus point of Tinder is that it allows you to socialize. I needed that (socializing) the most as I had heard it again from my boss this time that I needed to work on social skills and then the boss added "and to develop social skills, you need to socialize, mix with people, interact more". 

I have been trying very hard to not think about the faults and flaws in that app but it seems that every time I found a flaw in the situation, life took a turn at that point. And I cannot stop thinking about it.

For example, I had got my first match with this girl and I was talking to her and I realised that Tinder didn't have an in-app implementation of emoticons. But this girl was using them so I asked her and she taught me that Android keyboards have built-in emoticons. Wow, that was new information.Â 

Then the second thing was that there was no notification to show if the other person had viewed the message.Â 

Third was that if I would turn off vibrations in my phone, Tinder would silently push the notification on the display without making any sound. I feel bad and frustrated even while writing this and regret that Tinder didn't think of theseÂ things from a user experience point ofÂ view.

Well, the way I am complaining here, I had complained to that girl also and ruined the things for me. She immediately got it that I was new to the app and that I didn't like it. Take away from this story is that poor usability might not mean anything to the developers but to the end users it could mean end of many relationships. 

<span class="" style="display: none;">DEFENSIVENESS: It was not that I had Tinder on my mind already. It was not even on my phone. I knew what this app was about because I had used itâ€™s free subscription a year or two before. </span>
