<pre>I am the worst friend ever. It was 25th of Feb, 2022, 01:46 AM. I wasn't able to catch sleep. And the memories of Andy Fisher were overwhelming me. I tried call to him, gave him a ring but he did not pick up.
Now, you may be thinking that I reached out to him at very wrong time. Or that I am expecting too much from him in this hour past midnight but these expectations from Andy have built over time. 

Let me tell you why so? And how so?

Andy is suffering from Ankylosing spondylitis.

He stays awake whole night due to backache at times and sleeps for only for 3 hours, more or less.

I tried to call Andy a second time but he didn't pick this time either. I am very interested in knowing how he manages to pass the time being awake when the rest of the world sleeps. I too am not able to catch sleep the entire nights a few times and it makes me sick.

When I called him the following day to get the words about the life altering illness that he is suffering from, he refused to co-operate giving the reason that his medical details are not on a blog where am writing sex stories about who fucks whom, and who sleeps with whom.

Now let's talk science a bit here:
<i><b>Ankylosing spondylitis</b>

Also called: Bechterew's disease
Overview: An inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine and large joints.
The condition is more common among men and usually begins in early adulthood.
Common: More than 1 million cases per year (India)

# Treatable by a medical professional

# Requires a medical diagnosis
Lab tests or imaging always required

Chronic: can last for years or be lifelong </i>

There are no specific lab tests to identify ankylosing spondylitis. Certain blood tests can check for markers of inflammation, but inflammation can be caused by many different health problems. Blood can be tested for the HLA-B27 gene.

<b>Is HLA-B27 positive curable?</b>

There's no cure for ankylosing spondylitis (AS), but treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatment can also help delay or prevent the process of the spine joining up (fusing) and stiffening.

Ankylosing spondylitis is both an autoimmune type of arthritis and a chronic inflammatory disease. An autoimmune disease develops when your body attacks its own healthy tissues. Ankylosing spondylitis is also an inflammatory condition that involves inflamed or swollen joints.

Well, these are enough of notes from the internet based on hints, clues, bits of information that Andy gave to me whenever we met.

Am not sure if we HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, USA) like data-and-privacy laws in India but I am going to take this risk for the greater good, whatever be the consequences.

Andy doesn't deserve this. Andy doesn't deserve to suffer from Ankylosing spondylitis. Andy doesn't deserve to die. I am not gonna let him die. Not that easily, at least.
He already has a lot of signs of this disease like sleepless nights, puffy eyes, low immunity, pain in the back when rests and pain in the thighs / upper legs.
But he struggles very hard to keep things normal with respect to the different aspects of life, his life.

May God bless him with a long life, a very, very, very long life. He is one of those people whom I consider as my friends.
Thank you for reading.
