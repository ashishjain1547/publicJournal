<pre>June 3, 2011

It was a fine day, I was feeling relaxed as there is three day gap between yesterday’s paper and the paper on sixth. I studied OS whole day. It was really tiring last night and it felt good to sleep last night. I was checking out playboy website in the morning and I don’t know like into porno again, it is sick when you feel the urge to do that. It is like a drug addiction, feels really sick and weak inside.

I was studying in my place in the evening and Shruti comes here to talk. Buaji was keeping a check on us when our conversation was going on.

Vibha was texting me since morning, I didn’t reply to the morning message and then in the evening when her second message of the day came, I didn’t bother. In the fifth message she wrote. “Ignorance is a chain”. I did not give a f*ck, and her sixth message came around ten asking me if was angry on her, and she told me not to worry about the exam as I am capable enough; I believe that was a demeaning truth. I went down around 2210 and wished her best of luck for exams and also for the night with a kiss. The problem was that Ankur had been sitting downstairs on fufaji’s computer, fufaji was reading a book, and Rakesh hadn’t left yet. It has been time when second message of Vibha had come around 1830. Rakesh didn’t go until 2030 and after that Ankur sat on the machine to study, I couldn’t have said anything. He had heard from fufaji and badi buaji over the phone calls he get whole day long and Shruti had told buaji about this girl calling him innumerable times. He was angry over Shruti and partially over me. He deleted the Playboy movie which I had downloaded. I didn’t say anything.
Amma had called and I also talked to babaji.
God bless me
Ashish
