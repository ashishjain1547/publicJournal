<b>Happy Birthday, Sameer!</b>

I started the day with exercise. I went to the open grassy walks at the back of the society. I feel really awful sometimes to know that my height is short. I came back home at about 1100 and was watching movie afterwards. 
Aunt went to temple, and when she returned she just threw fits on me for not putting the side-chairs down from the sofa. She said she had told me this thing before leaving, and guess what, she hadn’t. Plus, I was just about to put them down before she entered the door so that makes me feel not guilty. We got pretty much into verbal mess, but it never became a brawl. 

I watched the movie and it was good. But, I was never in good mood, felt pissed as reached my bed, as if my whole body is too familiar with the surroundings of that corner of the house.

Prachi was eating lunch with Anu and Prashant. I went to have a bath. And after that, I spent sometime in sharing jokes with Anu and Prachi. I didn’t want anything to go wrong, in my absence. Who can trust a ten-year-old?

I was just never all right after today’s incident. I kept thinking about it, it was all over my head. I was feeling bad, guilty. All the time, I wanted nothing actually and I just slipped when the moment was lose. 

I was just mad over what I had done and I sat on laptop in my room, thinking about writing for today. Aunt went out somewhere in the evening with Srishti.
I watched “Mr. And Mrs. Smith” till seven and then I was texting Vibha. Her first text came when I was watching movie and I didn’t bother to reply. 

<i style="color: blue">Vibha: I thnk v shud tlk nw.

Ashish (after half an hour): Yes, pls.

Ashish: Try to reply msgs earlier than half an hour...

Ashish: I would love to be like them, i take tht as a compliment! B-)

Ashish: You got a choice.... Man makes mistakes (I aint god) and fools repeat them.

It was about 2230 that I had dinner and I was in bed later thinking about the today. 

God Bless ‘Me’
