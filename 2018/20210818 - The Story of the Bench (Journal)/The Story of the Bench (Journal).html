Is bench a bad thing?

Some of you might not even be aware of what I am going to talk about and yet you might think that a bench is that place to sit you find in a public park.

All of you are right whether you know what a bench is.
Because ultimately both are made for people who do not have anything to do.
The bench in a corporate company is a code attached to your profile that signifies that you do not have a project.

What exactly is a bench code?

1. Transition phase as move between projects:
Once your project gets over, you fall on bench. Next, you appear in client interviews to get back into a project code.

2. Starting phase:
When you join a service-based company, you start with a bench code.
Then you would be immediately interviewed for the position or profile you were hired for.

The interview that you crack to join the company has little to do with the client interview so keep preparing while you are on bench.

3. Disciplinary phase:
If you do something that your manager has to put you off the project, he or she deallocates you from the project and put you on bench code.
Any misbehavior, bad language, absence from meetings, inconsistent timings of logging in and logging off, drugs, information security breach may result in you being unmapped from project code and mapped to a bench code.

I would share my experiences when I first joined the company in August 2018 and was on a weeklong bench of “Type 2”.
The bench for new joiners is a bit different from the way experienced folks take it.
New joiners have questions of this sort:
1. Who can get me a project?
2. Whom do I talk to?
3. What trainings, courses, certifications should I take?
4. What if I get the work that matches my profile and interest?

All of these were my questions too. At that time, I called everyone to everyone I knew was related to my company: Kunal Jain (from Manu Apartments), Abhishek Shukla (from NIEC), Employee Relations HR, Business Process HR, Talent Planning Department manager, co-joiners, and whom not.

Luckily, I got the call in next one or two days from my project manager and I got the project.
An interesting thing had happened during this time: I was having a perplexed face, demotivated soul, and loneliness one afternoon when I was going towards Employee Care Center and Rohit Sud found me. That was a game changer, and my life turned a bit positive and less punishing that moment on.

Due to shortage of time: I'd answer the question with which we started: Is bench a bad thing? 
Answer is: Yes, it may affect your appraisals, promotion, hike, track record, image and career.
