<pre>It was one of the toughest times that I can recall. The ~45 days between 4th of July to 15th of August.
The life at Mobileum had become chaotic.

Yaju was trying to get into "Education, Training and Documentation" team.

He had expressed his interest to his managers and leadership like Pankaj Saxena, Chandrashekhar Marathe, and also submitted request to the one man department of Education and Training but got rejected and was given warning in kindest words.

Pankaj Saxena had told him that if Yaju does not take up more than the usual work from the NTR team, he might have look for job somewhere else.
It was a portent to firing that was to happen in the coming months.

Prashant Saxena was frustrated with me, I was frustrated with Prashant Saxena.

My frustrations were because of the nature of work I was getting of testing and people management of Vibrant Info developers like Nitin Khachadiya and all. To follow up on the tasks of these people I was being repeatedly chased after 6.30 or 7 to provide the status or have a face time with Prashant.
By this time, I was over with my third semester exams at BITS Pilani and was going to get into fourth semester for project after summers break.
Like Yaju, I too had submitted a request to Shekhar (Chandrashekhar Marathe) to put me in Data Science team reporting directly to him. At first, he asked for NOCs from my current managers like Dinesh Sawant and Prashant Saxena.

Once I got the approvals, Shekhar aligned me for an interview with the only data scientist Rachit reporting to him.

Rachit asked me what was I familiar with. I said Linear Regression and then he started grilling me with the questions that were not relevant to a Linear Regression course but that were still important concepts that one working in industry should know.

The question was : what all conditions do you check for, what all assumptions you make about the data set before applying Linear Regression.

I was denied of an opportunity at Mobileum.

Since overall speaking, I was frustrated with the work and manager. Feelings that I can definitely say were mutual, I had started to give interviews.

One such interview was with DunnHumby. I cleared the first round of online programming test but screwed up in the face to face round that happened on one of the weekends.

The manager asked some questions about Pandas and I didn't know the answer to any of his questions. He did ask me a couple of questions in SQL but I think I gave wrong answers there too.
Once I had updated my profile on Naukri.com for data science related jobs like Data Scientist and Data Analyst, I was getting calls from companies that asked me if I knew Pandas. I said 'no' to them earlier but several telephonic interviews later I learnt that Pandas was a must-have skill for my profile.

After I was relieved from the job with a notice period of 45 days, I gave numerous interviews. And that was just the beginning.
