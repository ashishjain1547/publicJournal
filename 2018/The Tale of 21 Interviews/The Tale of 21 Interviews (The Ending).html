After having been interviewed around Linear Regression, and discussing Machine Learning topics with Vivek Kothari, I took courses on Statistics from Khan Academy and Datacamp.
Those courses helped set up the base and foundation for Data Science.
Next step was learning Pandas. I had read the book on Pandas but clearing interview requires more than that.
So here I was: Learning a new technology from scratch and giving interviews on it at the same time.

I remember this interview at a start-up in Gurugram (Gurgaon) and they gave me a task to solve. It was a mix of EDA and Business Analytics.
I spent days learning Pandas and implementing it for the interview assignment.
After seeing my code, I was called for a face to face round. I learnt here that the job was more related to Business Analytics than Data Science or Machine Learning.
Even though, the rejection looks obvious to me in the hindsight today but at that time in 2018, every rejection had hurt like a punch in the face.

One thing that I was doing wrong or crazy while interviewing was: 
I was applying for every tool and technology I knew of. I was desperate.

I was applying for: UI/UX roles using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AngularJS. 

I was applying for: backend developer or software engineer roles using Java. 

And, I was applying for roles requiring Data Science and Machine Learning knowledge.

I had roughly 40 days with me from the Independence Day of US to Independence Day of India. After that, Mobileum was not going to pay as notice period was to end by then.

One interview I remember was at a training institute in Noida.
They tested me for Java. Gave me a score of 4 out of 20. And said that they would still hire me and I could have a great career with them. The owner said, "you don't know where this institute can take you".
Except for one glitch, they asked me for Rs 50,000 as joining fee and they also had some dubious terms and conditions.
The institute name was Diction Technologies.

My cousin Srishti helped set up an interview at Amdocs. The interview at this product based company was a shocker.
The interviewer shared a screen, wrote some code and asked me to tell the output.
Never in my life I had imagined an interview like this. I knew Java because of working on Omicron and not because of Mobileum. I flunked here at Amdocs too.

I had also interviewed at TCS, they saw a dozen technologies in my resume and realised that I knew nothing. At last, they asked me a question related to HTML that I remember answering correctly. The question: 
What difference does it make if we move the script tag from top to bottom?
After that, they said I was done for the day.

I had gone to the extremes of interviewing. I was called to interview at a teaching institute that wanted to hire me for Data Science and Python trainer. After taking a demo class from me on Linear Regression, the owner looked at me in disappointment and asked "why would you take up job for lower salary than your salary at the last job?". I was sent home with the message that "I was done for the day and that I would hear from HR on results in coming days."

Even though I have talked extensively of my failures, by the time India's Independence Day was to come, I had two job offers in Data Science.

One at Resurgent Technologies' subcompany ScoreMe Solutions and second one was at Infosys.

I joined Infosys and the rest is history. 
Thank you for reading.
