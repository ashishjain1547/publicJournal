<pre class="">It is not a complete post yet (as of 20210420). I would not want readers to draw conclusions from it.
    I have few rudimentary ideas and learnings about surveillance that do not encompass the complete picture and everything about surveillance.
    
    <b class="">1. Habits</b>
    
    <i class="">Habits are easier to form but harder to get rid of.</i>
    
    Originally, the quotation might have been that "Habits are easy to form but hard to get rid of" and then people would argue that even habit formation is not easy. So, here we use the comparative form of the adjectives (easier and harder) while comparing "forming habit" and "getting rid of habit".
    
    <b class="">2. Sensitization</b>
    
    Psychologically speaking, sensitization is the process by which <b class=""><i class="">sensitizer</i></b> is able to <b class=""><i class="">give rise to emotions</i></b> in the <b class=""><i class="">sensitizee</i></b> through the use of <b class=""><i class="">object of sensitisation</i></b>.
    
    <b class="">3. Object of sensitisation</b>
    
    This could be like something that is shown repeatedly to the sensitizee.
    
    3.1. Colors: 
    <i class="">Do you have started to see some colors very often?</i> Such as in:
    
      3.1.1. dressing of the people, 
      3.1.2. cars in car parking or in traffic
    
    3.2. Sounds
    <i class="">Have you recently noticed that you may be getting distracted by some souds?</i>
    
      3.2.1. Such as of a person living on the floor above you and knocking the floor or maybe moving some heavy object.
      3.2.2. Construction sounds in your neighborhood.
      3.2.3. Honking of cars.
      3.2.4. Closing of car doors or hood.
      3.2.5. Slamming of doors.
      3.2.6. Slamming of door knobs.
      3.2.7. Screaming of people such as vegetable sellers <i class="">(such as in Sector 7, Panchkula)</i>. 
    
    <b class="">4. Your Characterstics And The Characterstics of 'Object of Sensitization' That a Sensitizer Would Target to Sensitize You</b>
    
    4.1. Something that you want: 
    
      4.1.1. This could a car (like a car brand that you often look for in traffic).
      4.1.2. Women dressed attractively.
    
    4.2. Something that you have.
    
      4.2.1. Like a weapon.
      4.2.2. Drugs
      4.2.3. Money
      4.2.4. Or could be anything precious to you that you would not want others to know about.
    
    4.3. Something that you don't want.
    
      4.3.1. For example: loud noises
      4.3.2. Colors. For example: <i class="">Elon Musk has been known to make insensitive jokes and tweets about the LGBTQ community so he might not want to see (or might get annoyed by) Rainbow flags (or LGBTQ pride flags) in a crowd he might be addressing.</i>
    
    <b class="">5. Anxiety</b>
