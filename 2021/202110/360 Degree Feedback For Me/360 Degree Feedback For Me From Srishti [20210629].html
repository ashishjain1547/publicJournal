<b class="">A. Start Doing</b>

1. Taking care of yourself more and have some normal basic fun things- alone or with people. (For example I like to cook food for myself and watch Netflix alone.) Do something that you enjoy and makes you relax.

2. Elevate/improve your lifestyle a little bit - occasional cooking for yourself, better living conditions, spend money on yourself - grooming, clothes etc. & get a hobby.

3. Connecting with family once in a while and being transparent with them. Let them know you’re okay. Ask them how they’re doing for a change. Everybody has their own problems. It’s good to keep in touch.
Your family will always be there for you no matter what. 

4. Meditate or talk to therapist on a regular basis.

<b>B. Things to continue doing</b>

1. Being independent

2. Keeping in touch with our roots and practising non-violence which ingrained in us. (I hope you’re doing that. It goes a long way.)

3. Keep focusing on your job and being educated. That’s very important. 

4. Keep taking your medication seriously and following it timely as prescribed by the doctor.

5. Keep continuing to dream of having your own startup one day - even if it’s at 50. Keep it alive if it’s your passion. 

<b>C. Stop Doing</b>

1. Fixating on money a lot. 
Nobody becomes a bigger/smaller person by having more/less money. It’s just something you use to buy basic necessities for yourself and family. But real happiness is not from that. 

2. Fixating on property stuff. You’re better than that. It doesn’t take anybody anywhere. 

None of that feeling was worth cutting off your grandparents for so long. Be happy with what you have. At least you don’t have a big family to feed or old family loans to repay. You’ll get whatever there is later in life - don’t keep waiting for that. And none of that should matter to you anyway - you’re educated, you can create whatever you want for yourself. (That’s how we all were raised, never heard of any property talk before, never even thought of it. I was surprised to know that you think of all that. I know for myself - that I’ll create everything myself and don’t need anything passed down to me.) 

3. Stop being unreachable and aloof all the time. 

4. Stop rushing in life. Like marrying, buying a house etc. Don’t put an ‘age’ number to these things. Do things at your own pace. There is no ideal speed for it.
