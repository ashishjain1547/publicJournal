<pre>Mornings and evenings I spent with Sakshi were all my guilty pleasures.

The first time I saw her, she was wearing heals and the gait was a cat walk.
She is an eye candy when her makeup is on.
And you can drown in her dark circles, otherwise (when she is without make-up).

The first time I saw her, she had this perfect feline gait in those heals. It tempted me to talk to her and I did. It changed my life completely in the next few months till December.

I was living a lonely life, she had brought some fun it, some taste, some flavor in it. Till it became sour. (Oh no, no, I didn't taste her, somebody else did. :D)

Those lunch outings from my pocket were okay. Those lunches and evening snacks at McDonald's from my pocket was okay. Those bowling arena visits with her and her friends were okay. Those times when she visited my rented room was okay.
Those shopping mall visits, those wholesale market visits were okay.
Those expensive meals at expensive food outlets was okay.
Those spa and salon visits from my pocket were okay.
Those visits to movie theatres was okay. 
But then she did something that was beyond my wildest imaginations.

An entire Shimla trip from my pocket with her and her friends was not okay.

~ ~ ~

I don't travel much. I do believe that I like traveling but most of my traveling happens between Delhi and Chandigarh and that too by the high speed Kalka Shatabdi Express train.
When Sakshi suggested that we should plan a trip to Shimla over a weekend, I felt it would be pretty exciting. Weeks went by and at times when we spoke about it, she would say she would make that trip with her brother. Or that she would make that trip with her friends, but not with me alone. I was like "huh", as expected. But then she did plan a trip with three of her friends and me in the week ending in Christmas.

Dinesh was at the wheels. His girlfriend (and also a friend of Sakshi) Shivani was at the front seat. I was sitting behind Dinesh. Sakshi was sitting on the other window seat, behind Shivani. And in the middle of Sakshi and me, sat Navjeet.

Navjeet is 6 ft. 2 in. like tall hulk. He tells stories of his performance in Boxing rings and of his dogs (two Pakistani Bullies). 

I was already upset with this arrangement of seating because on the day before Sakshi had told me that I would be sitting at the front next to Dinesh, but now I was with this giant.

First thing I could think of was the upcoming purchase I had to make for Navjeet and Dinesh as a treat to them for my birthday gone by. Bottles of expensive drinks. Burnt 4000 bucks there for them.

I got a bottle for myself and I was sleeping on our way to Shimla while listening to sounds of lip-locks, kisses and smooches. And this was just the beginning.</pre>
