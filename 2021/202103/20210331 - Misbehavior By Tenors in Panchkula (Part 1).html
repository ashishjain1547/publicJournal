My experience with tenors in my stay in Chandigarh / Panchkula has been pretty bad. I would go about them in points like this:

I had moved from Manimajra to Panchkula in February 2019 in (let's say) Address X<span style="display: none;">Abhishek Sindhwani's residence (1224, Sector 7, Panchkula)</span>. It was okay for few days in the beginning as the room had bed and almirah. The problems arose later that I should have anticipated while coming in.

1. There was no water tap. You have to either get the water from the market or drink the ground water.
    
2. The room had no curtains so you had no privacy as anyone from outside the room could view everything inside.

3. One of the windows (oppsite to the restroom door) had no metallic grill and anyone could break into the room by knocking down the glass pane.

4. The restroom would have two entrances from two separate rooms. The other room had space for two people, which means three people would be sharing the restroom. Note that the restroom was also the bathroom.

5. If the other tenants play loud music at the times such as mid night or hours past mid night, there was still little intervention or help from the tenor.

I had to leave the place afer the tenors did not fix the curtains and privacy problem after repeated requests made for a period of about two months.</span>
