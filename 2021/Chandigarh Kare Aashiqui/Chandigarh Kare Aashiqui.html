<pre>I was going to name this piece "Flirting with Chandigarh" but I remained stuck to "Chandigarh Kare Ashiqui" for two reasons. First, a friend of mine (Anushka Bhandari) suggested that "Chandigarh Kare Ashiqui" sounds cool while "Flirting with Chandigarh" does not have a ring to it. Second reason was because it was also the name of a 2022 Ayushmann Khurrana film.

<b>Now the story goes like this...</b>

I don't travel much. Therefore, I hadn't seen any place in Chandigarh and around.
But things changed in December of 2020.
I was suffering from high amount of stress and anxiety due to loud screams by vegetable sellers in my area in Sector 7, Panchkula.
I was reading a book at that time for my anxiety problem: <a href="https://survival8.blogspot.com/2021/02/anxiety-and-phobia-workbook-6e-edmund.html?m=1" target="_blank">Anxiety and Phobia Workbook (6e, Edmund Bourne)</a>
 
It suggested that traveling once in a while can help reduce and manage daily stressors of life.

I decided to step out every weekend then.
My first trip was to the Nada Sahib Gurudwara in Panchkula.

It was a trip that I undertook to broaden my perspective and knowledge about the Sikh community.
I had been in Chandigarh since 2018 but I never paid attention to culture, customs and traditions of Chandigarh. And hence a gurudwara as the first place.
The second place on the next weekend was Rock Garden.
It is an amazing place that talks about the efforts a man had put in beautifying a place.

Taking these trips would have been very tough had there not been the Rapido app at that moment.
With the Rapido app there, I only had to know where I wanted to go and that was all. The bike taxi would take care of the travel at a very low cost of below â‚¹100.
I would be out by 10:30 or 11 in the morning and back by 4 or 5 in the evening. Tired from the day's travel, I would sleep till dinner then dinner and sleep again.
I needed these trips very much as I was cutting caffeine to zero and I needed some kind of distraction, some way to stay out of bed, and some physical activity during the day.

In the coming week, I figured out that there was a group of college boys who would play soccer in the Vita park in Sector 7, Panchkula.
I would join them in the evening and then go to bed fully tired.

For a month, the things were okay but one evening my aggression took away all the fun. I was running after the person with the ball at full speed.
It wasn't just the person with the ball and me. I think there were one or two more people in the huddle for the ball.

Then I think from the shoulder push of one of those fellows, I tripped. My ribs hit the ground as I take the fall.
I was seriously hurt even if not visibly wounded.
That was how I spent my February.
In March, due to anxiety from vegetable sellers' screaming and yelling, I went to office everyday.
In the next couple of months, I would be exploring the Tibetan places "near me" (as in Google search query ;))
My weekends would spent out this way. Taking massage in the Tenzin Tibetan Spa in the morning from 10:45 AM (yeah, I remember the timings) then having lunch in Tenzin Tibetan Kitchen and spending entire afternoon there. Then I would come back home tired from the day's traveling. The thing was: These places were in MDC5 and I was staying in MDC6 at distance of 20 minutes walk from these places.
While I frequented these Tibetan places, I learnt a lot about the Tibetan people, about their religion, about Dalai Lama (whose picture you can find with every Tibetan person)
I also read three of the HH Dalai Lama's books.
My land and my people
The book of joy
And, "Happiness"

Reading these books was a very enriching experience for me. I was reading about the Tibet, the Tibetan people and that too directly from the mouth of their religious and political leader.
Moving ahead of books, there were a lot of movies also that I had started watching by the second half of the year 2021 in Chandigarh.
One such movie was about the Dalai Lama. It was "Seven years in Tibet".
True story of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who became friends with the Dalai Lama at the time of China's takeover of Tibet.
Tenzin Migtsam and her friends and staff were of the opinion that it would have been an Oscar winning film had it not clashed with the movie Titanic in the same year of 1997.
There were a lot of biopics that I watched after talking to my massage therapist Tenzin Pema (Yes, Tenzin again and every person named by HH Dalai Lama goes by the first name Tenzin as in Tenzin Migtsam, Tenzin Pema, Tenzin Tsering, Tenzin Kusang, Tenzin Dolma, Tenzin Kunsel, etc). She pointed me to movies like Sanju, Mary Kom and The Sky is Pink. She (and my workplace friend Anil Dahiya) had also suggested the movie Kabir Singh to me. I loved all of these movies. But the biggest changemaker was Ayushmann Khurrana.
I wasn't into movies but one evening on the occasion of quaterly team lunch, Amitabh Manu disclosed it to the team that his wife likes Ayushmann Khurrana. At that time I had made a comment on Kajal Singh's choice of Hindi TV soaps that "there is supposed to be some standard". To that Amitabh pointed out in a self-effacing humor that people  at times do things without thinking. He asked, "who is the actor in the movie Bala?"
As Amitabh is himself a bald man, there was some giggling in response to that question but I replied it was Ayushmann Khurrana. And, then he added, "my wife likes his movies a lot, he is her favorite."
The reason for telling you all of it is when I started watching movies (again, for a change) I made sure to watch Bala. And with that I was hooked to him. I watched all his movies till date and also went to the theater to watch the movie "Chandigarh Kare Ashiqui". That was my last in theater in the December 2021.

Before that I had seen several movies on the consecutive weekends. That included movies like F9 (Fast and Furious 9), Venom 2: Let There be Carnage, Dune, James Bond movie: No time to die, The Marval Universe film: The Eternals, etc. This also included a Punjabi movie of the singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh titled 'Rakh Hosla' with Sakshi Dahiya.

With Sakshi Dahiya, I explored the market places (like Sector 7 Panchkula, Sector 19, Sector 35, etc) and malls (like Elante, DT Mall by DLF Builders in IT Park outside Infosys campus, Fun Republic Mall in Manimajra) in Chandigarh. Then there were vists to the Bowling Club SMAAASH and the final outing/trip to Shimla to top it all. 

That was all about my experiences from Chandigarh all of which happened in 2021, a great year from this perspective!</pre>
