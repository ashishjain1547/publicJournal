<pre class="">This is about my time in Tri Nagar for roughly two months before I came to Chandigarh in 2018.

The entire house was a storeroom for unused and waste items along with bricks and stone blocks. The grandma's room was filled with wood pieces (big and small) of Shyam and grandpa's room had the sofa set, table and single bed. These items had been adjusted so the room was completely packed leaving no room for anyone to even stand.

At first I had tried to adjust into the environment but it was not possible. I would be in the room on the side of 73rd street upstairs. Sitting there on the floor to use my laptop was okay for some time but not for long for extended hours.
Everyday we would be removing some of the wood pieces and waste items from the first hall (grandma's room). At first, the way to grandpa's room was cleared. I was still advised that I take every care while passing from the first hall as the wooden girders had bent from the middle due to the load of the stone blocks. Some stone blocks were completely taken off from the point right above where the fan hook was (which was the main weight that had resulted in the hole in the roof). Everytime it would rain, the water would make the entire roof to become heavy and weak.
The waste had a lot of items that belonged to my grandma such as the small trunk (small as if to store 12-15 novels) with religious reading material. There was a round wheat grinding stone. There were some other trunks that contained electrical items (such as wires and sockets and two old ceiling fans (these were the ones that weighed over a kilo)) or kitchen utensils. 

Mom was reluctant to touch these trunks but I insisted that small kitchen utensils (such as glasses and plates) should be put into use, religious items be removed, electrical waste be removed as they are there as they are not being used anywhere.

There was a time when my mom and I had a huge conflict. I was of the opinion that mice and rodents should be done away with by any means. Mom is a religious person and she said that she does not mind that mice are there. When she would learn about steps I had taken to deal with rodents, she said "they are the vehicle of lord Ganesha" and am neither religious nor pro-animal life.

There were some king-size utensils made of alloys (instead of stainless steel) that were not suitable for day to day use such as a flat circular dish (thaali), or wok, rolling pin and board (made of marble), the pots (patila) and et cetera. I got them removed too. 
With time, the furniture was also removed item by item as space was needed such as when Sri Bhagwan joined as a tenant in October. Grandpa's room got a paint work as Sri Bhagwan stayed in it and he also painted the windows and walls outside. The paint was a much needed improvement to make the room liveable. 

This was the first step towards invigorating life in that house.
