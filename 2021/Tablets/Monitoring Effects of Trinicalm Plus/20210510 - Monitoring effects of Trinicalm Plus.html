<pre class="">10/05/21, 17:28: Took one tablet of Trinicalm Plus.

10/05/21, 17:30:
SALT COMPOSITION
Trifluoperazine (5mg) + Trihexyphenidyl (2mg) [Read the end notes]

10/05/21, 17:30: Had finished lunch right before 17:28

10/05/21, 17:31: Yes, that's lunch.

10/05/21, 17:32: Auditory hallucinations.

10/05/21, 17:52: Having an anxiety from noise and auditory disturbances is one thing.
But when you start thinking that people are trying to communicate with you through this disturbance then that takes shape of a different 'psychological problem'.

10/05/21, 17:52: Subliminal voices that you can interpret, understand or associate with are a clear sign of the 'Different Psychological Problem'.

10/05/21, 18:00: I was working till now. Now I have got off the laptop and lied down in bed.

10/05/21, 18:06: You can counter the negative effects of tablet in your mood and thoughts by:
1. Relaxation
2. Making sure your breathing rhythm is natural. Meaning you are not taking short and shallow breaths.
3. Deep breathing

10/05/21, 18:07: First and foremost impact of this tablet is: It draws your attention towards you, towards yourself.

10/05/21, 18:08: Making you self-aware. Self-conscious.

10/05/21, 18:37: After you take this medicine, it is of great benefit and advantage if you are in a comfortable and secure environment without anyone's intrusion.

10/05/21, 18:38: Am in scrum call that started on 18:15.

10/05/21, 19:02: If you indulge in something that requires you to focus or required you to do mental processing or requires your attention, then you might notice that you are not able to fully enjoy the activity.

10/05/21, 19:03: The activity could be coding or reading, or having a technical discussion with colleagues, etc.

10/05/21, 19:36: If you have someone to talk to, with whom you can enjoy and who can make you feel happier and comfortable, that's a big relief from effects of this tablet.

<h4 class="">End Notes</h4>

<b class="">Drug 1:
Trifluoperazine HCL
Common Brand(S): Stelazine
Generic Name(S): trifluoperazine </b>

Ref 1.1: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11998/trifluoperazine-oral/details" target="_blank" class="">webmd</a>
This medication is used to treat certain mental/mood disorders (such as schizophrenia, psychotic disorders). Trifluoperazine helps you to think more clearly, feel less nervous, and take part in everyday life. It can reduce aggressive behavior and the desire to hurt yourself/others. It may also help to decrease hallucinations (hearing/seeing things that are not there). Trifluoperazine is a psychiatric medication that belongs to the class of drugs called phenothiazine antipsychotics. It works by helping to restore the balance of certain natural substances in the brain.This medication has also been used for the short-term treatment of anxiety. However, there are safer drugs to treat anxiety that should be used first before trifluoperazine. 

Ref 1.2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoperazine" target="_blank" class="">Wikipedia</a>

Trifluoperazine, sold under a number of brand names, is a typical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia. It may also be used short term in those with generalized anxiety disorder but is less preferred to benzodiazepines. It is of the phenothiazine chemical class. 

<b class="">Drug 2:
Trihexyphenidyl HCL
Common Brand(S): Artane
Generic Name(S): trihexyphenidyl </b>

Ref 2.1: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8720/trihexyphenidyl-oral/details" target="_blank" class="">webmd</a>

Trihexyphenidyl is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease or involuntary movements due to the side effects of certain psychiatric drugs (antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine/haloperidol). Trihexyphenidyl belongs to a class of medication called anticholinergics that work by blocking a certain natural substance (acetylcholine). This helps decrease muscle stiffness, sweating, and the production of saliva, and helps improve walking ability in people with Parkinson's disease.Anticholinergics can stop severe muscle spasms of the back, neck, and eyes that are sometimes caused by psychiatric drugs. It can also decrease other side effects such as muscle stiffness/rigidity (extrapyramidal signs-EPS). It is not helpful in treating movement problems caused by tardive dyskinesia and may worsen them.

Ref 2.2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trihexyphenidyl" target="_blank" class="">Wikipedia</a>

Trihexyphenidyl, also known as benzhexol and trihex, is an antiparkinsonian agent of the antimuscarinic class. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's in 2003.
