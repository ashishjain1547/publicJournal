<h4 class="">End Notes</h4>

<b class="">Drug 1:
Trifluoperazine HCL
Common Brand(S): Stelazine
Generic Name(S): trifluoperazine </b>

Ref 1.1: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11998/trifluoperazine-oral/details" target="_blank" class="">webmd</a>
This medication is used to treat certain mental/mood disorders (such as schizophrenia, psychotic disorders). Trifluoperazine helps you to think more clearly, feel less nervous, and take part in everyday life. It can reduce aggressive behavior and the desire to hurt yourself/others. It may also help to decrease hallucinations (hearing/seeing things that are not there). Trifluoperazine is a psychiatric medication that belongs to the class of drugs called phenothiazine antipsychotics. It works by helping to restore the balance of certain natural substances in the brain.This medication has also been used for the short-term treatment of anxiety. However, there are safer drugs to treat anxiety that should be used first before trifluoperazine. 

Ref 1.2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoperazine" target="_blank" class="">Wikipedia</a>

Trifluoperazine, sold under a number of brand names, is a typical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia. It may also be used short term in those with generalized anxiety disorder but is less preferred to benzodiazepines. It is of the phenothiazine chemical class. 

<b class="">Drug 2:
Trihexyphenidyl HCL
Common Brand(S): Artane
Generic Name(S): trihexyphenidyl </b>

Ref 2.1: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8720/trihexyphenidyl-oral/details" target="_blank" class="">webmd</a>

Trihexyphenidyl is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease or involuntary movements due to the side effects of certain psychiatric drugs (antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine/haloperidol). Trihexyphenidyl belongs to a class of medication called anticholinergics that work by blocking a certain natural substance (acetylcholine). This helps decrease muscle stiffness, sweating, and the production of saliva, and helps improve walking ability in people with Parkinson's disease.Anticholinergics can stop severe muscle spasms of the back, neck, and eyes that are sometimes caused by psychiatric drugs. It can also decrease other side effects such as muscle stiffness/rigidity (extrapyramidal signs-EPS). It is not helpful in treating movement problems caused by tardive dyskinesia and may worsen them.

Ref 2.2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trihexyphenidyl" target="_blank" class="">Wikipedia</a>

Trihexyphenidyl, also known as benzhexol and trihex, is an antiparkinsonian agent of the antimuscarinic class. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's in 2003.
