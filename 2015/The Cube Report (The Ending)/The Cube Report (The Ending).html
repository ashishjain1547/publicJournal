<pre>Read a self-help book religiously and it becomes a self-kill book.

This happened with me with a Shiv Khera book, the title of which I don't remember now. Was it "You can sell"? Or "How to sell?" Or maybe "You are a seller!" God only knows!

The first time I had to use a line from that book, a project went out of the GUI team and went to the third party company Vibrant Info. The second time I used a strategy from that book and I got fired.
The Cube Report had taken some shape after two-three months of gruelling effort and with about 100-200 rows of data in the database at the back-end.
When it went Himanshu Malik, the heights of my happiness were sky-high and I was about to fall from there when test results were to come out.

Himanshu had some 1000 records for testing and the Cube or OLAP or Ad-hoc report failed to load with even this much amount of data.

I was so involved in getting the UI and look and feel of the report with the little dummy data of mine that I completely lost hold of all other ends.

Getting the report to Himanshu Malik (QA) was my first milestone and it also turned to be the last.

In the earliest phase, I immediately picked up the books on a couple of topics like iMAS, Oracle OLAP, Data Warehousing, Jasper Reporting, jQuery, etc. It was all part of learning and research. Also, I had learnt it in meetings with Prashant Saxena (the project manager) that there already existed a Cube report that was built on Jasper Reporting tool and now client was asking for a "second" one that Prashant Saxena thought would be built using iMas.

The problem was none of us (Prashant, Sneha and myself) knew iMAS to the required depth.
One day when I was discussing the tree structure of the report with Prashant using words like parent, child and family of nodes, he made jokes and laughed at it. That was my first eye opener that I was by myself in this mud.

The taste of all of it started to turn sour when Sneha had also stopped taking any updates. I was not involving Aniket because instead of thinking like a team player, I thought Aniket should not get any credit for my tasks, as I felt he was a credit seeker.

Now there were mails after mails from my ID under different headings every day as status updates to "roughly entire company". I had found out to whom Prashant reported, I knew Sneha reported to Chandrashekhar Marathe and Prashant's managers also reported to him as he was the VP of Engineering and R&D.

The one-way mail broadcasting went on for over a month leading to the final collapse of the project alongside with me.
Chandrashekhar Marathe uses just 'Shekhar' in his email signature and people used to call him just that, so I would too in this writing.
When the report didn't run on Himanshu's machine that were some more people added to the "distribution list" like Himanshu himself and his manager Sourabh Joshi.
I was trying to resolve the issue to no avail while continuing my research and studies and then finally putting it over mail that we may need to start over from scratch to build the Cube Report right.
Shekhar in one of the last mails tried to figure out what was going on and I told him over email that the report was not possible in iMAS and an SQL server, and that we might have to use Oracle OLAP.  

To make it very clear to everybody, I went on to saying that:
<i>"Oracle OLAP is not an expense but an investment."</i>

That was a line from the Shiv Khera's book.
From that day on, I was out of the two-three months long drama and I was transitioning out of the Cube Report to being available again for some other task.
And this is the time when Apurba Das, the actual team lead rejoined the office after coming back from the maternity leave.
There were few closing email exchanges between Apurba, Sneha, Shekhar and myself in which I was asked a couple of questions like a retrospective meeting for the project before that project went outside the team to Vibrant Info's Jasper team.

Thank you for reading! See you in the next post.</pre>
