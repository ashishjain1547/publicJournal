<pre>Year 2013

Placements start happening in seventh semester or by eighth semester in colleges where placements happen.
At my college ADGITM, I am not fully sure what was going on as part of placement programs because I was not eligible for one.
I had a backlog of couple of subjects, one of which was "Communication Systems", not "Skills".
When you are going for your first job interview, you do not have an anchor to start the discussion with the company.
The anchor is set by the company that may have come for select few recruitments or mass recruitment like TCS, Infosys and other service based companies of India.
If the company has come for mass recruitment, you again do not have an option.
If the company is open for negotiating the salary with you, then you have to the homework on following points:

1. How much has the company offered for your job role or position in the past?

2. How much are other companies paying for your job role at your college?

3. Can you get an offer from outside yourself?

All of these help in setting up your expectations when you are going in for salary negotiations for the first time.
At times what companies are paying you is not a number, not salary but a package.

A package consists for parts like:
1. Variable component linked to your performance.
2. Preference of location.
3. Joining bonus.
4. Early opportunity of promotion Or progression.
5. On-site opportunities
6. Work around technologies of choice or niche technologies.
7. Transparency around company's policies. Even before joining. Something shared to you like joining kit or onboarding documents.

Basically, what you will achieve by doing all this research is you will know where to set your anchor point?
What should act as a good reference?
What is the default option? That is, your salary if you don't negotiate.
You will know your BATNA. Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.
You will know your ZOPA. Zone of possible agreement.
ZOPA can be explained in a better way from the company's perspective. For knowing ZOPA: you will have to know two things. What is the maximum that the company can offer?
What is the minimum that the company has offered?
ZOPA is the difference between those two numbers.

You will know your walk-away point (also known as your reservation point).
Here, key thing to note is that: you should know your BATNA, ZOPA and Reservation Point as well as of the company before you enter the negotiation.

Every company has different BATNA, ZOPA and Reservation Point. So do your research thoroughly.

Moving forward to the next part in our discussion:
Let's say now you have a job offer and you are going in for a second interview.
Now your BATNA will change.
Your reservation point may or may not.
Your ZOPA may or may not. Your ZOPA may also vary depending on the company you are negotiating with, for example whether it is Google or Infosys.
Also, there will be a bit of an opportunity to initiate bidding. That is, you make the company you are negotiating with to bid against the offer that you have from the last interview.
That's exactly what people do.
So did I during my initial days.
The company I was working for (The Webplant) was paying me a package of 1.2 lac. I interviewed within 6 months and got a job offer of 2.5 lac from TechAhead software development company. At that time there was an interview that was happening in parallel, and on knowing that I had a job offer of 2.5 lac the HR there offered me a salary of 5 lac. It was Mobileum.

Once you join a company, the discussions that happen are called "Year-End Performance Evaluations".
Companies do your performance evaluation but may not revise your salary accordingly.

As your salary revision is based on a lot of other factors like company's performance. Your LOB's (line of business) performance.
Economy's performance. For example: the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The salary revisions at your company's competitor company. For example, Infosys and TCS are competitor companies.

The tricky part about performance evaluations is that the person who will evaluate your performance (your manager) and the person who will be managing your project and work are two different people.

For example: Sneha Kiran was my manager when I joined Mobileum, and project managers were people like Prashant Saxena, Rajesh Jindal, Rupesh Patodi, Kavita Surve, etc.

To end this piece: If you think you deserve a higher salary, go for it and negotiate with your boss but remember that your needs do not become the fictional <a href="https://survival8.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-one-thing-by-gary-keller-15-minutes.html" target="_blank">Begging Bowl</a> with infinite capacity to hold money.
