<pre>When I first heard from Apurba Das over email, it was in the aftermath of the Cube Report failure.
She was writing emails to me to seek details, code, configuration, design details and knowledge from me regarding that failed VMCC Cube Report.

Now whenever she was sending me a mail, Sneha and Shekhar would also be there, but whenever I would be replying to her, I would remove Shekhar. And she would be adding him back with the trailing mail underneath.

I was irritated, angry, embarrassed, upset, humiliated and with a lot of negative emotions at that time, and now dealing with this investigative team leader who had just come back from maternity leave and wanted the details from scratch.

The day came when we both lost our nerves and we were sending replies to each other's mails in the heat of the moment with Sneha (manager) and Shekhar (vice president) in the CC. No, I wasn't removing Shekhar from loop in the last few quick and heated exchanges.

What Apurba was asking was that I do a fresh setup of Cube Report on her system.
I had already done the setup for Cube Report on a Linux server and I was repeatedly pointing to that but she was insisting that I do it on hers. 
At last, I had to refuse to this demand saying that she should do the setup herself if she needs it on her system, otherwise the setup is anyway present on the server.

Then came the phone call that broke the ice and the ugly pattern between Apurba and me. I was talking to her for the first time and she had this Bengali English accent that made her appear soft and friendly. When she asked me about the Cube Report, I expressed my wish to not get involved in it (there was a second reason also behind it than just my disappointment). She said okay and told me that it was just a friendly call to check up on me. 

This Cube Report based interaction with Apurba Das gave me the feeling that I was in crosshair with her, but she turned out to be a friend later on.

The second reason motivating me to move out of Cube Report was an erstwhile sent task related mail by Sneha. She was asking me about a configuration screen in an application called AMMS managed by Rajesh Jindal who was also located in Gurugram.

Over this period of time, the dust about Cube Report had settled and I was on call with Sneha again (and Apurba) on which she was seeking the work estimate from me for me for a configuration screen.

And I reopened the Shiv Khera book titled "You are a salesman" again.

This time the line I was looking for was:
<i>Always under-promise and over-deliver.</i>

With that I gave my estimate for the screen as 5 days. 

From there began my long run with AMMS. I was a bit overwhelmed with emotions on being given this second chance and I think I did a decent job this time.
Thank you for reading. </pre>
