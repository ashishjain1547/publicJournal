<b class="">Level 5:</b>

Babaji’s mother was a native of Sonepat, Haryana. Babaji’s parents had lived in Gohana, Haryana.
Grandma’s family lived in BADSHAHPUR (near Gurgaon), Haryana. Amma was ten when her family moved to Delhi in around 1947. Amma tells of the Hindu-Muslim riots happening around the city during that time of country’s independence.
After marriage, amma moved to Gohana where babaji’s family lived. Babaji was practicing in Delhi, and used to visit Gohana to see his family often. Four of six children had their birth in Gohana, only Rekha buaji and Manju buaji were born in Delhi.

<b class="">Jainism and its influence on my grandparents</b>

Amma has always been very religious and holds very strong belief in God and Jainism. She went to a Jain school as a child, and she didn’t do schooling after fifth standard. At the Jain school, she was taught all the prayers, the rituals, the beliefs, rules and practices of Jainism. Her school wasn’t a separate body, but in conjunction with the temple.
She has a small metallic tray that was distributed in her school on the occasion of first republic day of our country, Jan-26-1951.

Babaji’s family had always held positions in the management of the temple. Phool Chand Jain was the president of the temple management body, and his cousin brother, Padam Jain had some prominent position in the management. Babaji’s distant-cousin and Padam Jain’s son became temple’s cashier later.

Around in 1950, when babaji got down with serious illness, which he recollects as TB, Phool Chand Jain went to Ayodhya to bring and set up the orange-marble idol of Lord Mahavira in the temple. The central main idol is about 900 years old, from the times of TUGHLAQ'S rule in Delhi, 1200 AD. There is a saying, ‘the older the temple, the more are the powers in it’. The idol that Phool Chand Jain brought is kept in the left section of the temple, and at about three feet, the idol is the largest idol present there, the main idol is about two feet high. The main hall in the temple is itself not very large, with the three sections covering an area of about 8-by-4 meters-squared.

<b class="">Manu Apartments</b>

Mavilla apartments put up silver-jubilee banner, society was 25 years old (1987-2012).
As amma tells, the cost of the flat in Manu Apartments had come up to be 4 Lacs (0.4 million INR). That should be the cost to investor buyers.

30-40 years ago: babaji had registered in the court with a person for the land for the lawyers for some R200 and since then they had be giving the installments as were required until the flats were ready. He got lucky in the draw and got the first flat, the flat number one.

The flat now stood at 15 million INR as the base value for the owners. Otherwise, its present let-out sale price for a buyer will be over 30 million. That is 90 times the investment value for the flat 25 years ago.
