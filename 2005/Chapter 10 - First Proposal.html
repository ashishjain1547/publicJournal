<pre>I was one month through my tenth, year 2006, during the summer vacations I made my first ever email ID from Amogh’s house. And the very first email that I had sent was a proposal, yes a proposal and the girl was Sonal (^_^). Huh, as I was new to all this internet stuff I was unable to recognize the email I got from Mailer-Daemon, i.e. actually the failure notice from Yahoo, and then I asked Sonal the next day “you didn’t reply to my email.” She questioned back “did you send one?” I said “yes, I sent you that I love you and I like you very much.” Uh, big mistake! (Not that big though ;)) She (may be in anger/ frustrations) sent me her reply that-

<i>First of all,
....HUUUHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Second of all,
Why do you like me in this blazing hell????</i>

Oh great, man, I was unable to understand the phrase above. I was a coward then and a coward now… I sent her, “Oh that works! I actually sent you that to check how we receive an email as that question is surely going to be answered by anyone in this world.”
I was really impressed by her English as she is four years younger than me standard wise and even then when I was in tenth I used to make mistakes in tenses, using different forms of verbs and all other common grammatical as well as dramatically mistakes.
The ID I had used was ‘crazyboy_17_jain@yahoo.co.in’ and her was ‘designer_sonal1994@yahoo.com’, which is still used by as an alternate address.
It all had started even before the time I am talking about. It started in the winters of November/ December when they girls for the first time came to play TT with us, actually not with us but then in the TT basement (A6 block basement).
I got 75 off 100 in tenth class board exam, which was probably because I failed to score even 40 percent in the reading section and that’s because I didn’t know what ‘kindergarten’ meant. The whole passage was based on that word and I didn’t know that the word was elongation for KG.
