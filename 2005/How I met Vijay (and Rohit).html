<pre>It was the summer of ‘05. I was a student of Ahlcon Public School. A class 8th student. My elder sister was in 9th standard. I often used to visit her and knew many friends of hers. I believe a lot of them identified me from my face if not name. 

And this lead to a big confusion. I wish I could say it was a comedy errors. It was a horror though. Nothing less than a disaster for me. There’s a famous “Nothings well that does not end well”. It turned out reality that day.

A classmate of my sister was on duty where she had to record the names of students coming late to school. So if someone reaches school late thrice a month, they had to post a fine. Although I lived so near to the school that I could literally skip hop and jump out of my bed and reach school in less than a minute. However, I was still late. So that girl whose name was divya wouldn’t bother to ask my name and mark my late arrival infront of my classmates name Achal Kaushik all by herself.

Neither Achal nor I had any idea of that girls creativity. So when Achal received a memo to pay a fine for being late to school, he was taken aback. So Mr. Vijay, a Math teacher and also the class teacher of my sister sent Divya to bring Achal from his class. Divya came in my class, called out for Achal while maintaining a solid eye contact with me. She looked a little puzzled and took me to their class eventually.

Mr. Vijay was a talented guy. He could write with both hands. I use to like him before this day. As that girl entered, she said this guy is Achal. I refused and I said I am Ashish. She immediately cooked up a story and said that I said my name was Achal the very first day when I reached school late. So afterwards, she herself marked me as late. She could have bothered to ask me my name again or read my name on my ID card. She choose not to.

I looked into Anu’s eyes and she was all puzzled with the proceeding. Mr. Vijay got up from his seat and warned me to speak the truth or beat the consequences. I stood my ground and said I was speaking the truth only.
This guy went crazy. He started hitting me. Slap after slap. 7, 8 or May be 10. Now I know he can hit with both hands too. There was pin drop silence in the class. But despite his warnings that he will take me to principal or the incharge, I maintained that I was not lying.
He kept hitting me. 

A friend of mine was also in that class and I could see all of them shell shocked. They met me later and told me how brave I was to not shed a single tear after being hit so badly in front of 40 new students. Looking at my firm resolute, they were really impressed. When I walked out of that class, they sent Anu outside to check on me. She kept telling me to speak the truth. But I was speaking the truth all along and no one believed.

Apparently, vijay then scolded Divya to do her job properly. An eye witness told me that she started crying as she came back to her seat. But what about me? That over clever girl who couldn’t even remember a name properly was all free while I was insulted to the core infront all new faces. It was embarrassing for both Anu and me.

Divya still owes me an apology. And Vijay, you better not cross paths with me. I am a black belt kung fu fighter (in my head).

God bless me.
