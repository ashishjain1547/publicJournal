<pre>• Gurarchi was my classmate from fifth to eighth and then again in high school. She went into the A section for Hindi as a subject in Ninth, I went into B for taking Hindi. There were five sections in Ninth, off which A, B, C were for Hindi, and D, E were for Sanskrit. A section had Praful, Aishwarya (Kumar) from my previous year classmates.

• I was in sixth. I used to go to buaji’s house in those days occasionally. Her house was on rent in those days. The owner of the house had a daughter; she was younger than I was, probably two to three years younger. She had come up to buaji’s house; I was already there. Buaji was dressing up to go somewhere. I was just checking my clothing out in the process. Then I corrected something on myself and turned to the girl to ask how was I looking? Oh, that was smart! Buaji quickly came in between, “boys don’t ask such questions to girls.”

• On a lab computer when I was sixth, may be seventh, grade somebody wrote in my name that, “I love watching blue films.” Anu brought this news home. Somebody had shown this thing to her. It was the topic of conversation. People asked different questions; I did not care about my image much, because I did not use to care for other people much. I still feel it was a plot against me by my then-enemy Achal Kaushik. He had an elder brother and he probably got me into this. 
Around that time, I was also accused of writing “I like Sukanya, very much, this and that” on the table by the students. It was just another act of Achal. The students critically took me but I can now understand why the teacher did not speak to me about it. It was a pure conspiracy against me. 
In fifth standard, I had borrowed a notebook from Sukanya one day and at home, the rumors had developed that Ashish is on with Sukanya. Anu and I used to share the room. She had sowed the seeds for it. This probably had formed the basis for that act.

• When I was in middle-high, I had such an effect on my little friends in society that whenever they had some problem among themselves they would come to me to ask for my say on the situation. I would be at home studying my own schoolbooks, or preparing for any test and they would come on my balcony to call me there and then put their questions up.

• In ninth and tenth standard batch, there was a student Amrit who was about six feet tall and how he had fancied about his photo on his web page on Orkut and today how social networking is a part of everybody’s life. He used talk dirty about his phallus being 4 inch tall, 6 inch tall while in erection. He would tell of the progress of it coming up. “Now it’s 60%, now it’s 80%!”
