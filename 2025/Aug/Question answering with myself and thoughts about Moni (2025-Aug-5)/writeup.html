‚ÄúWhat was I doing last night?‚Äù
Before going to bed, I was making news posts on Blogger using my AI tool. The topic of concern was the usual ‚ÄúLayoffs‚Äù, ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù, among others.
I had bad dreams about layoffs in the IT industry in general. About how Moni is treated by her employers in her baby-sitting job as if nannies or maids aren‚Äôt human beings.
First I woke up around 12.30 AM then Moni sent me to sleep forcibly, then the second time I woke up again around 3.10 AM. This second time I sat on my laptop to write some code for the AI tool to convert News webpages from various sources into summarized blog posts on my Blogger handle.

I think that was mostly it. I got up from my mat and bed-table around 6.30, and was on walk on society peripheral from 7 to 7.40 (I think, I did 5000 steps üôÇ)
8-9.30: I was sleeping
Then I had bath and breakfast (some poor tasting Vermicelli, üòÄ)

Sometimes I think about Moni and think about myself. How large her life is despite having so little, and how little my life is despite having so much. To say that she has faced all possible pains Lord Krishna can give would be a bit of an exaggeration but she would not be too much short of that. She wakes up at 5 AM in the morning to do the household chores and cook food. By 7 she leaves to arrive at Princy‚Äôs house to do her cooking (breakfast and lunch) and then she would go to Alankrita's place to take care of Asher. At Alankrita‚Äôs place, she expected to take care of Asher, cook their meals and also keep the house clean. Sometimes the entire day goes by standing, without sitting and yet Alankrita‚Äôs husband would not be happy / satisfied with Moni. Lately she asked for half day off on Sunday and these people only let her go around 4.30-5 in the evening. Just about an hour before her time. 
Sometimes she would complain of pain in her thighs, sometimes in the back, sometimes her eyes would be troubling her due to dryness (though this one is because she rides scooty without a proper windshielded helmet).
The day before yesterday, we were at the mall (Zudio and Vishal Mega Mart in Sector 89) and Mahi wanted a pair of footwear that were priced about Rs 600-700. But Mahi chose to let them go, to not go for them after talking to Moni. Moni convinced her that these footwear were not in her budget. Yet the mother and daughter are happy. Moni‚Äôs life makes me feel so little.
I feel ashamed. I wasted the entire day today and also was snoozing here and there yesterday. Let me get back to work.
