I don't know I miss Chandigarh sometimes. 
“Then what is it that I don't know?” 
The experiences, the life became sour once the surveillance team from Manu Apartments picked up again.

“Why Manu Apartments? How is it Manu Apartments?”
No proof. But purely on hyper-excitement and ominous gut feeling I got whenever I was there. Particularly when I got to see Suresh anywhere in society. 

“But what's the point of it all?” 
“Why write about it today?”
No point, no reason except that it (writing) helps calm down my nerves. 

Digressed a bit too much :D
What I wanted to write about was my “super good” days in Chandigarh. Just a note - “super good” is relative from people to people and experience too.

Just before those good days, I had suffered too much harassment in the Dr Batra's house.
Shouting vegetable street peddlers, disturbance from Narendra (if I am recalling his name right) and his roommates, anxiety from high tea/caffeine doses…. Just that I wasn't keeping well (which is a rather polite way to put it)... I remember going to office even on weekends in March of that year 2021 but personal work, it was still work - I was setting up things on GitHub and moving files out of my laptop - brilliant strategy, something that has lasted with me even till date.

I was tired, I was in bad shape, I needed rest. I have had enough.
I changed my room to a kothi in Sector 6, Panchkula right behind Infosys campus (which was basically Chandigarh). I was basically on the Chandigarh and Panchkula border, but still a posh area. 

Here is sector 6, Panchkula, there was construction of houses going on in some houses near to my place and if I am not wrong, I was bothered by this as well.
That was because one of the houses under construction was right in the zone about 2-3 houses away and I was bothered by the construction sounds. 

Amid this turmoil, I found a way to soothe myself. I found a way to peace. I found a way to change. I found a way to relax. 

I had found my way to a spa. Tenzin Tibetan Spa.
I was a life changing experience, one that lasted till this date.
I felt that the time ahead of my now was amazing and of high exploration. It was great time there till things went out of control with Sakshi Dahiya (friend at Infy) by the year end and I came to Delhi.

The lesson I learnt was this: There is no harm in stealing a bit of moments here and there in peace, luxury and relaxation. 
I found the experience life altering and I think the cost (will come to that later) was worth it.
