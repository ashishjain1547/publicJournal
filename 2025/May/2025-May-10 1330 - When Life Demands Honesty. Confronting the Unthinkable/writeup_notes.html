“What would I do if it were my last day on Earth?”

“What would I do differently if it were my last day on Earth?”

“What would I do if I were to lose my job today?”

“What would I do differently if I were to lose my job today?”

If it were my last day on Earth:
May be I would go out and meet people.
I think I don’t have a lot of human touch in my life.

Whom would I like to meet?
I would like to meet Rohit Sud.
I would like to meet my sister Anu and my jiju.
I would like to meet my mother. 

What would I say to them?
I would say “I apologize for being selfish. I apologize for not asking you how your day was? I apologize for not being there when you might have needed an ear.”

I think that’s all. 

---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   ---   ***   

If I were to lose my job today:
I would open my finance sheets and do the math of how long I can be without a job.
After that: I would meditate and wonder about what I might have done wrong. What could I do right in my next job?
And yes, I would prepare for my interviews coming here on.

I have funds to last for about 7-8 months.
I have not been proactive in communication at my current job (same was the issue during my last days at Infosys).

I would prepare for coding and algorithms, I would prepare for AI/ML (and the several subjects associated with it).

“What do I do to enjoy myself?”

“How do I enjoy?”

“What do I like doing just for fun?”

I do a couple of things like reading, walking, spending time at the gym (rarely but enjoy it when I do) to enjoy myself but I almost every time do a cost benefit analysis of it and do it for “right reasons” rather than just for the fun of it.
“If I were to die today or lose my job today, I would still somewhat like to catch a breath for a day, to clear my thoughts. It is messy out there.”
