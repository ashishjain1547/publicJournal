<pre>“What really matters when you die?”
“What really matters when you are dying?”

Once you are dead, I don't think anything matters thereafter.
But once you are dying… Is it wrong to ask for a little bit of comfort, a little bit of support of “a family”? Or are we supposed to just be aware of our death and accept it the way it is?

“What if you are in sickness? What if you are sick?”
Are we just supposed to pass away quietly still? Without bringing any discomfort to anyone, anybody.

One thing I am definitely not supposed to worry about is the expectations of other people. If they are “empty handed”, they would like a dollar. If they have a dollar, they would want 2 dollars or 10 dollars.

You can't even die in peace. Just if you like more context, I am talking about my mother.

I don't know what I am talking about. I don't know what to write about. 

This day of low health (but really good weather with cloudy sky and a day out at the temple) made me think about my death in my meditation. 

Speaking of death: what are my assets and what are my liabilities?

At the end of the day, a conversation about death circles back to money and finance.
How much do you have?
How much do you owe?

I owe my SBI bank some 41 lakh rupees. But that is a home loan, considered a “good loan” - one that is backed by an asset.

Surprisingly, nothing else :D 
There was a car loan also but I repaid that one. :D

My assets are at a low. At about 3.5 lakhs. I mean I wouldn't know what I would do in an emergency. Times are tough.

Dikhya just pinged with a “?”
I sent her a quick text “call?” Followed by :
“I was not keeping well.
Could not raise the matter with you.
Apologies for my absence. Pls convey my message to your father also who was trying to reach out.
Not a good day. Feeling low.”

I hope it resolves the issue and any miscommunication or any communication gap.

I think I am going to watch one of Ankur Warikoo's videos on Finance and rest and relax with it.

There is this book by Ankur Warikoo that's titled “Make Epic Money”. I don't know what to make out of the title because sometimes making Epic money would seem like an unreasonable target when all you want to do is just come out of a financial trough.

Thanks!
God bless!
