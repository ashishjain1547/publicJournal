It's a familiar feeling, isn't it? That stretch of free time, yawning open, and the accompanying confusion about how best to fill it. Lately, my default has been turning inwards – meditation, or perhaps outwards to the curated wisdom of YouTube motivational talks. The goal is always the same: seeking a fresh lens, a different angle on the currents of daily life.

Yesterday, this digital exploration led me down a particularly thought-provoking path. A TEDx talk titled “Memento Mori” – Latin for “Remember Death” – resonated deeply. It wasn't morbid, but rather a stark reminder of life's finitude, urging a focus on what truly matters. As often happens in the algorithmic world, this opened a door to Stoic philosophy, a school of thought I've been dipping into, seeking its practical wisdom for navigating modern complexities. I even felt compelled to capture my initial thoughts on “Memento Mori” in a separate post.

This quest for perspective plays out against the backdrop of daily responsibilities. My day was filled with the technical demands of the Network Engineering Assistant project – testing, troubleshooting, liaising with support, and guiding teammates. The usual rhythm of work provides its own structure.

But life rarely stays neatly compartmentalized. An afternoon message brought a different kind of challenge. Harshita's mother had apparently called multiple times. I hadn't felt well and hadn't returned the missed calls promptly. Her message conveyed a sense of urgency: “Ashish my mom called you many times... when are you free after 4pm she wants to talk to you”.

When I did call back later that evening, the conversation quickly pivoted to expectations. Could I get a premium train ticket and travel to Ajmer immediately to meet Harshita? My preference for a more budget-conscious approach was met with, perhaps, surprise. Then came the question about my mother's involvement, leading to a discussion about differing views on finding marriage matches – local versus online bureaus, offline meetings versus long-distance expectations. Nisha Mehta (as she introduces herself) noted the trend towards online searches, yet the expectation remained for me to travel, echoing a past experience where a potential connection fizzled after a similar invitation.

It's in these moments – the intersection of philosophical reflection, daily work, and complex personal interactions – that the real learning happens. Remembering mortality, embracing Stoic acceptance of what we can't control, and navigating the often-unspoken expectations of others... it's all part of the journey. What did I learn? Perhaps that clarity doesn't always come from filling free time, but from observing how we respond to all of life's moments, the planned and the unexpected.
