<pre>Under the warm embrace of a June sun in 2012, I witnessed the celebration of Grandpa's 83rd birthday, marking a chapter in our family's saga. Born in 1928, he stood as a living testament to our ancestral tapestry. Amma, seven to eight years his junior, shared her roots through her UIDAI card, revealing the year 1936 as her birth year.
Allow me to take you to the narrow lanes of Gohana, a town steeped in the tales of my ancestry.
Lalu None Rai, a figure shrouded in the ambiance of the temple, graced the initial layer of our ancestry. Ganwar Lal, the second layer, led us to the intricate stories of Ugrasen Jain, Phool Chand Jain, and Maksoodan Lal, forming the third layer. Phool Chand Jain, Grandpa's father, became the linchpin, leaving behind two sons—Digamber Prasad Jain and Hem Chand Jain.
Gohana, a town near Sonepat, resonated with familial echoes. Phool Chand Jain orchestrated a setting in Tri Nagar, Delhi, in 1958, where Grandpa and Hem Chand Jain eventually settled. Their history intertwined with the tapestry of Gohana, a town that evolved from Rohtak district into a main subdivision with its own municipality.
As the tale expanded to encompass Babaji's roots, we discovered a connection to Sonepat for his mother and to Badshahpur, near Gurgaon, for Grandma's family. Amma's recollections painted a vivid picture of their relocation to Delhi in 1947 amidst the Hindu-Muslim riots during India's struggle for independence. Gohana became Amma's new home after marriage, a place where Babaji's legal practice in Delhi led to frequent visits to his familial abode.
Jainism, an invisible thread woven into the fabric of our existence, shaped Amma's religious fervor. Her early education at a Jain school imbibed in her the rituals, prayers, and beliefs, grounding her in the essence of Jainism.
The temple, a spiritual nucleus, witnessed the active involvement of Babaji's family in its management. Phool Chand Jain's journey to Ayodhya in 1950, amidst his son's battle with a serious illness, brought an orange-marble idol of Lord Mahavira to the temple, enriching its spiritual legacy.
Manu Apartments, a contemporary landmark, marked a financial odyssey from a 4 Lacs investment to a present-day value exceeding 30 million INR. The story of the apartment complex encapsulated the changing fortunes of the family over 25 years.
As the first chapter of our familial saga unfolded, Gohana stood as more than a geographic location—it was a testament to resilience, change, and the enduring spirit of our ancestry.

<h3>My Schooling and Grandparents' Years of Birth</h3>

The narrative expanded beyond my roots in Gohana to the classrooms that shaped my early years. Born on December 18, 1991, at St. Stephens Hospital, New Delhi, my academic journey began at Municipal Corp. Gov. Primary School, transitioning to Maharaja Agrasen Public School and later Ahlcon Public School.
The chronological progression continued through high school and culminated at Northern India Engineering College, affiliated with Indraprastha University. The quest for knowledge carried me to Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, and ultimately to the metaphorical University of Hard Knocks, the College of 'survival8'.
A comprehensive list of educational milestones marked each year, encapsulating experiences, friendships, and the evolution of my academic self.
Amidst this journey, the years of birth for my grandparents painted a parallel narrative. Digamber Prasad Jain, my grandfather, entered this world on June 12, 1929, and embarked on a lifelong journey with Darshan Mala Jain after their marriage on February 7, 1955. Grandpa's journey concluded on February 19, 2021, leaving behind a legacy that extended to the roots of our family tree.
As the pages turned, Shail Bala Jain's brief life, born on September 5, 1956, left an indelible mark despite her departure in the first standard. Viresh Chandra Jain, my father, born on November 27, 1958, added his chapter to the family story, leaving us on April 24, 2012.
The family tree expanded, weaving a tapestry of generations, births, and relationships that resonated through the corridors of time. The incomplete saga continued, leaving room for the stories yet to unfold in the generations to come.
